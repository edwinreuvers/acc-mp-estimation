    "This website presents the complete, reproducible workflow of our [manuscript](https://link.com). The entire project was built using [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. By using Quarto, we seamlessly embedded all analysis, code, figures, tables, and results into our manuscript. This approach ensures that every result in the manuscript is **directly traceable to its source code and data**, with no ambiguity about how it was produced. Interested readers can reproduce our results by rendering the Quarto project in its entirety.\n",
