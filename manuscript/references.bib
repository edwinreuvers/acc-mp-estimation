	abstract = {Muscles coordinate multijoint motion by generating forces that cause reaction forces throughout the body. Thus, a muscle can redistribute existing segmental energy by accelerating some segments and decelerating others. In the process, a muscle may also produce or absorb energy, in which case its summed energetic effect on the segments is positive or negative, respectively. This Borelli Lecture shows how dynamical simulations derived from musculoskeletal models reveal muscle-induced segmental energy redistribution and muscle co-functions and synergies. Synergy occurs when co-excited muscles distribute segmental energy differently to execute the motor task. In maximum height jumping, high vertical velocity at lift-off occurs desirably at full body extension because biarticular leg muscles redistribute the energy produced by the uniarticular leg muscles. In pedaling, synergistic ankle plantarflexor force generation during leg extension allows the high energy produced by the uniarticular hip and knee extensors to be delivered to the crank. An analogous less-powerful flexor synergy exists during leg flexion. Hamstrings reduce crank deceleration during the leg extension-to-flexion transition by not only producing energy but delivering it to the crank through its contribution to the tangential (accelerating) crank force, though this hamstrings function occurs at the opposite (flexion-extension) transition when pedaling backwards. In walking, the eccentric quadriceps activity in early stance not only decelerates the leg but also accelerates the trunk. In mid-stance, the uni- and biarticular plantarflexors, by having opposite segmental energetic effects, act in synergy to support the whole body, so segmental potential and kinetic energy exchange can occur. To conclude, the extraction of unmeasurable variables from dynamical simulations emulating task kinematics, kinetics, and EMGs shows how the production of force and energy by individual muscles contribute to the energy flow among the individual segments during task execution.},

	abstract = {Current understanding of how muscles coordinate walking in humans is derived from analyses of body motion, ground reaction force and EMG measurements. This is Part I of a two-part review that emphasizes how muscle-driven dynamics-based simulations assist in the understanding of individual muscle function in walking, especially the causal relationships between muscle force generation and walking kinematics and kinetics. Part I reviews the strengths and limitations of Newton–Euler inverse dynamics and dynamical simulations, including the ability of each to find the contributions of individual muscles to the acceleration/deceleration of the body segments. We caution against using the concept of biarticular muscles transferring power from one joint to another to infer muscle coordination principles because energy flow among segments, even the adjacent segments associated with the joints, cannot be inferred from computation of joint powers and segmental angular velocities alone. Rather, we encourage the use of dynamical simulations to perform muscle-induced segmental acceleration and power analyses. Such analyses have shown that the exchange of segmental energy caused by the forces or accelerations induced by a muscle can be fundamentally invariant to whether the muscle is shortening, lengthening, or neither. How simulation analyses lead to understanding the coordination of seated pedaling, rather than walking, is discussed in this first part because the dynamics of pedaling are much simpler, allowing important concepts to be revealed. We elucidate how energy produced by muscles is delivered to the crank through the synergistic action of other non-energy producing muscles; specifically, that a major function performed by a muscle arises from the instantaneous segmental accelerations and redistribution of segmental energy throughout the body caused by its force generation. Part II reviews how dynamical simulations provide insight into muscle coordination of walking.},

	abstract = {Induced acceleration analysis quantifies the contributions of individual moments and forces to the accelerations, reaction forces, and powers produced during a task. The analysis has been advocated in the assessment of muscle and joint moment function during locomotion. However, results and interpretations drawn from the analysis have differed considerably between studies. The purpose of this paper is to assess whether induced acceleration contributions to locomotion dynamics are physically well defined. The assessment was facilitated by the analyses of a simple, theoretical locomotor task using different models. The task was based on a planar, rigid-body simulation in which joint moments at the hip, knee, and ankle posturally supported the configuration of the body as it rolled forward in a pendular motion. Induced acceleration analyses were performed using four models that completely described the simulated dynamics of the task but represented progressively fewer degrees of freedom. The contributions of each joint moment to the ground reaction force and trunk and leg powers differed between models, even though the net contributions were identical for all models and consistent with the simulation. Moreover, when all body degrees of freedom were represented in the model, large power redistributions between the trunk and leg were attributed to individual joint moments. However, these redistributions mostly cancelled such that the net redistribution was modest. In a single-segment model, this net redistribution was attributed entirely to gravity, without any cancellation of power flows. To conclude, induced acceleration contributions to the dynamics of a task are not physically well defined. The application of the analysis in the assessment of muscle and joint moment function during locomotion should be critically reevaluated.},

	abstract = {Cycling power decreases substantially during a maximal cycling trial of just 30s. It is not known whether movement patterns and joint powers produced at each joint decrease to a similar extent or if each joint exhibits an individual fatigue profile. Changes in movement patterns and/or joint powers associated with overall task fatigue could arise from several different mechanisms or from a complex interplay of these mechanisms. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the changes in movement and power at each joint during a fatiguing cycling trial. Thirteen trained cyclists performed a 30s maximal cycling trial on an isokinetic cycle ergometer at 120rpm. Pedal forces and limb kinematics were recorded. Joint powers were calculated using a sagittal plane inverse dynamics model and averaged for the initial, middle, and final three second intervals of the trial, and normalized to initial values. Relative ankle plantar flexion power was significantly less than all other joint actions at the middle interval (51±5\% of initial power; p=0.013). Relative ankle plantar flexion power for the final interval (37±3\%) was significantly less than the relative knee flexion and hip extension power (p=0.010). Relative knee extension power (41±5\%) was significantly less than relative hip extension power (55±4\%) during the final three second interval (p=0.045). Knee flexion power (47±5\%) did not differ from relative hip extension power (p=0.06). These changes in power were accompanied by a decrease in time spent extending by each joint with fatigue (i.e., decreased duty cycle, p{\textless}0.03). While central mechanisms may have played a role across all joints, because the ankle fatigued more than the hip and knee joints, either peripheral muscle fatigue or changes in motor control strategies were identified as the potential mechanisms for joint-specific fatigue during a maximal 30s cycling trial.},

	abstract = {In the literature, it has been hotly debated whether the brain uses internal models or equilibrium point (EP) control to generate arm movements. EP control involves specification of EP trajectories, time series of arm configurations in which internal forces and external forces are in equilibrium; if the arm is not in a specified EP, it is driven toward this EP by muscle forces arising due to central drive, reflexes, and muscle mechanics. EP control has been refuted by researchers claiming that EP trajectories underlying movements of subjects were complex. These researchers used an approach that involves applying force perturbations during movements of subjects and fitting a mass-spring-damper model to the kinematic responses, and then reconstructing the EP trajectory using the estimated stiffness, damping, and measured kinematics. In this study, we examined the validity of this approach using an EP-controlled musculoskeletal model of the arm. We used the latter model to simulate unperturbed and perturbed maximally fast movements and optimized the parameter values of a mass-spring-damper model to make it reproduce as best as possible the kinematic responses. It was shown that estimated stiffness not only depended on the ?true? stiffness of the musculoskeletal model but on all of its dynamical parameters. Furthermore it was shown that reconstructed EP trajectories were in agreement with those presented in the literature but did not resemble the simple EP trajectories that had been used to generate the movement of the model. It was concluded that the refutation of EP control on the basis of results obtained with mass-spring-damper models was unjust.},

	abstract = {Several types of equilibrium point (EP) controllers have been proposed for the control of posture and movement. EP controllers are appealing from a computational perspective because they do not require solving the ?inverse dynamic problem? (i.e., computation of the torques required to move a system along a desired trajectory). It has been argued that EP controllers are not capable of controlling fast single-joint movements. To refute this statement, several extensions have been proposed, although these have been tested using models in which only the tendon compliance, force?length?velocity relation, and mechanical interaction between tendon and contractile element were not adequately represented. In the present study, fast elbow-joint movements were measured and an attempt was made to reproduce these using a realistic musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Three types of EP controllers were evaluated: an open-loop α-controller, a closed-loop ?-controller, and a hybrid open- and closed-loop controller. For each controller we considered a continuous version and a version in which the control signals were sent out intermittently. Only the intermittent hybrid EP controller was capable of generating movements that were as fast as those of the subjects. As a result of the nonlinear muscle properties, the hybrid EP controller requires a more detailed representation of static muscle properties than generally assumed in the context of EP control. In sum, this study shows that fast single-joint movements can be realized without explicitly solving the inverse dynamics problem, but in a less straightforward manner than implied by proponents of conventional EP controllers.},

Purpose:

It was investigated to what extent control signals used by human subjects to perform submaximal vertical jumps are related to control signals used to perform maximal vertical jumps.

Methods:

Eight subjects performed both maximal and submaximal height jumps from a static squatting position. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded as well as electromyographic (EMG) signals from eight leg muscles. Principal component analysis was used analyze the shape of smoothed rectified EMG (SREMG) histories. Jumps were also simulated with a forward dynamic model of the musculoskeletal system, comprising four segments and six muscles. First, a maximal height jump was simulated by finding the optimal stimulation pattern, i.e., the pattern resulting in a maximum height of the mass center of the body. Subsequently, submaximal jumps were simulated by adapting the optimal stimulation pattern using strategies derived from the experimental SREMG histories.

Results:

SREMG histories of maximal and submaximal jumps revealed only minor differences in relative timing of the muscles between maximal and submaximal jumps, but SREMG amplitude was reduced in the biarticular muscles. The shape of the SREMG recordings was not much different between the two conditions, even for the biarticular muscles. The simulated submaximal jump resembled to some extent the submaximal jumps found in the experiment, suggesting that differences in control signals as inferred from the experimental data could indeed be sufficient to get the observed behavior.

Conclusions:

The results fit in with theories on the existence of generalized motor programs within the central nervous system, the output of which is determined by the setting of parameters such as amplitude and relative timing of control signals.},

To optimize endurance cycling performance, it is important to maximize efficiency. Power-measuring cranks and force-sensing pedals can be used to determine the mechanical effectiveness of cycling. From both a coaching and basic science perspective, it is of interest if a mechanically effective pedaling technique leads to greater efficiency. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different pedaling techniques on mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency during steady-state cycling.

Methods:

Eight male cyclists exercised on a cycle ergometer at 90 rpm and 200 W using four different pedaling techniques: preferred pedaling; pedaling in circles; emphasizing the pull during the upstroke; and emphasizing the push during the downstroke. Each exercise bout lasted 6 min and was interspersed with 6 min of passive rest. We obtained mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency using pedal-reaction forces and respiratory measures, respectively.

Results:

When the participants were instructed to pull on the pedal during the upstroke, mechanical effectiveness was greater (index of force effectiveness = 62.4 ± 9.8\%) and gross efficiency was lower (gross efficiency = 19.0 ± 0.7\%) compared with the other pedaling conditions (index of force effectiveness = 48.2 ± 5.1\% and gross efficiency = 20.2 ± 0.6\%; means and standard deviations collapsed across preferred, circling, and pushing conditions). Mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency during the circling and pushing conditions did not differ significantly from the preferred pedaling condition.

Conclusions:

Mechanical effectiveness is not indicative of gross efficiency across pedaling techniques. These results thereby provide coaches and athletes with useful information for interpreting measures of mechanical effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 

Maximal cycling exercise has been widely used to describe the power-velocity characteristics of lower-limb extensor muscles. This study investigated the contribution of each functional sector (i.e., extension, flexion, and transitions sectors) on the total force produced over a complete pedaling cycle. We also examined the ratio of effective force to the total pedal force, termed index of mechanical effectiveness (IE), in explaining differences in power between subjects.

Methods:

Two-dimensional pedal forces and crank angles were measured during a cycling force-velocity test performed by 14 active men. Mean values of forces, power output, and IE over four functional angular sectors were assessed: top = 330°-30°, downstroke = 30°-150°, bottom = 150°-210°, and upstroke = 210°-330°.

Results:

Linear and quadratic force-velocity and power-velocity relationships were obtained for downstroke and upstroke. Maximal power output (Pmax) generated over these two sectors represented, respectively, 73.6\% ± 2.6\% and 10.3\% ± 1.8\% of Pmax assessed over the entire cycle. In the whole group, Pmax over the complete cycle was significantly related to Pmax during the downstroke and upstroke. IE significantly decreased with pedaling rate, especially in bottom and upstroke. There were significant relationships between power output and IE for top and upstroke when the pedaling rate was below or around the optimal value and in all the sectors at very high cadences.

Conclusions:

Although data from force-velocity test primarily characterize the muscular function involved in the downstroke phase, they also reflect the flexor muscles' ability to actively pull on the pedal during the upstroke. IE influences the power output in the upstroke phase and near the top dead center, and IE accounts for differences in power between subjects at high pedaling rates.},

Alterations of the mechanical patterns during an exhaustive pedaling exercise have been previously shown. We designed the present study to test the hypothesis that these alterations in the biomechanics of pedaling, which occur during exhaustive exercise, are linked to changes in the activity patterns of lower limb muscles.

Methods:

Ten well-trained cyclists were tested during a limited time to exhaustion, performing 80\% of maximal power tolerated. Pedal force components were measured continuously using instrumented pedals and were synchronized with surface EMG signals measured in 10 lower limb muscles.

Results:

The results confirmed most of the alterations of the mechanical patterns previously described in the literature. The magnitude of the root mean squared of the EMG during the complete cycle (RMScycle) for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) from 85\% and 75\% of Tlim, respectively. A higher RMScycle was obtained for gluteus maximus (P {\textless} 0.01) and biceps femoris (P {\textless} 0.05) from 75\% of Tlim. The k values that resulted from the cross-correlation technique indicated that the activities of six muscles (gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris) were shifted forward in the cycle at the end of the exercise.

Conclusions:

The large increases in activity for gluteus maximus and biceps femoris, which are in accordance with the increase in force production during the propulsive phase, could be considered as instinctive coordination strategies that compensate for potential fatigue and loss of force of the knee extensors (i.e., vastus lateralis and vastus medialis) by a higher moment of the hip extensors.},

	abstract = {Introduction/Purpose 

Cycling is a repetitive activity using coordinated muscle recruitment patterns to apply force to the pedals. With more muscles available for activation than required, some patterns produce high power, whereas some are more efficient. The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between muscle coordination and factors affecting muscle coordination to explain changes in overall mechanical efficiency (ηO).

Methods

Surface EMG, kinematics, and pedal forces were measured at 25\%, 40\%, 55\%, 60\%, 75\%, and 90\% V˙O2max. Principal component analysis was used to establish muscle coordination, kinematic, and pedal force patterns associated with high and low ηO.

Results

At 55\%–60\% V˙O2max, ηO was maximized and was highly related to the muscle coordination patterns. At high ηO, there was more medial and lateral gastrocnemii and soleus; less gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, and tibialis anterior; later medial and lateral vastii and biceps femoris; and earlier semitendinosus muscle activity resulting in an even distribution and synchronization of peak activity. Also, the ankle was more plantar flexed through the top and downstroke of the pedal cycle and more dorsiflexed during the upstroke for high ηO. The ηO was independent of the pedal force application.

Conclusions

The results indicate that increased ηO is achieved through the coordination of muscles crossing the same joint, sequential peak activation from knee to hip to ankle, and reliance on multiple muscles for large joint torques. Also, muscle activity variability across the top and bottom of the cycle indicates that left and right leg muscle coordination may play a significant role in efficient cycling. These findings imply that cycling at 55\%–60\% V˙O2max will maximize the rider’s exposure to high efficient muscle coordination and kinematics.},

	abstract = {It is currently unclear whether the brain plans movement kinematics explicitly or whether movement paths arise implicitly through optimization of a cost function that takes into account control and/or dynamic variables. Several cost functions are proposed in the literature that are very different in nature (e.g., control effort, torque change, and jerk), yet each can predict common movement characteristics. We set out to disentangle predictions of the different variables using a combination of modeling and empirical studies. Subjects performed goal-directed arm movements in a force field (FF) in combination with visual perturbations of seen hand position. This FF was designed to have distinct optimal movements for muscle-input and dynamic costs while leaving kinematic cost unchanged. Visual perturbations in turn changed the kinematic cost but left the dynamic and muscle-input costs unchanged. An optimally controlled, physiologically realistic arm model was used to predict movements under the various cost variables. Experimental results were not consistent with a cost function containing any of the control and dynamic costs investigated. Movement patterns of all experimental conditions were adequately predicted by a kinematic cost function comprising both visually and somatosensory perceived jerk. The present study provides clear behavioral evidence that the brain solves kinematic and mechanical redundancy in separate steps: in a first step, movement kinematics are planned; and in a second, separate step, muscle activation patterns are generated.},

	abstract = {Bicycle pedaling has been studied from both a motor control and an equipment setup and design perspective. In both cases, although the dynamics of the bicycle drive system may have an influence on the results, a thorough understanding of the dynamics has not been developed. This study pursued three objectives related to developing such an understanding. The first was to identify the limitations of the inertial/frictional drive system model commonly used in the literature. The second was to investigate the advantages of an inertial/frictional/compliant model. The final objective was to use these models to develop a methodology for configuring a laboratory ergometer to emulate the drive system dynamics of road riding. Experimental data collected from the resulting road-riding emulator and from a standard ergometer confirmed that the inertial/frictional model is adequate for most studies of road-riding mechanics or pedaling coordination. However, the compliant model was needed to reproduce the phase shift in crank angle variations observed experimentally when emulating the high inertia of road riding. This finding may be significant for equipment setup and design studies where crank kinematic variations are important or for motor control studies where fine control issues are of interest.

	abstract = {Algorithmic differentiation (AD) is an alternative to finite differences (FD) for evaluating function derivatives. The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate the computational benefits of using AD instead of FD in OpenSim-based trajectory optimization of human movement. The secondary aim was to evaluate computational choices including different AD tools, different linear solvers, and the use of first- or second-order derivatives. First, we enabled the use of AD in OpenSim through a custom source code transformation tool and through the operator overloading tool ADOL-C. Second, we developed an interface between OpenSim and CasADi to solve trajectory optimization problems. Third, we evaluated computational choices through simulations of perturbed balance, two-dimensional predictive simulations of walking, and three-dimensional tracking simulations of walking. We performed all simulations using direct collocation and implicit differential equations. Using AD through our custom tool was between 1.8 ± 0.1 and 17.8 ± 4.9 times faster than using FD, and between 3.6 ± 0.3 and 12.3 ± 1.3 times faster than using AD through ADOL-C. The linear solver efficiency was problem-dependent and no solver was consistently more efficient. Using second-order derivatives was more efficient for balance simulations but less efficient for walking simulations. The walking simulations were physiologically realistic. These results highlight how the use of AD drastically decreases computational time of trajectory optimization problems as compared to more common FD. Overall, combining AD with direct collocation and implicit differential equations decreases the computational burden of trajectory optimization of human movement, which will facilitate their use for biomechanical applications requiring the use of detailed models of the musculoskeletal system.},

	abstract = {Estimation of muscle forces during motion involves solving an indeterminate problem (more unknown muscle forces than joint moment constraints), frequently via optimization methods. When the dynamics of muscle activation and contraction are modeled for consistency with muscle physiology, the resulting optimization problem is dynamic and challenging to solve. This study sought to identify a robust and computationally efficient formulation for solving these dynamic optimization problems using direct collocation optimal control methods. Four problem formulations were investigated for walking based on both a two and three dimensional model. Formulations differed in the use of either an explicit or implicit representation of contraction dynamics with either muscle length or tendon force as a state variable. The implicit representations introduced additional controls defined as the time derivatives of the states, allowing the nonlinear equations describing contraction dynamics to be imposed as algebraic path constraints, simplifying their evaluation. Problem formulation affected computational speed and robustness to the initial guess. The formulation that used explicit contraction dynamics with muscle length as a state failed to converge in most cases. In contrast, the two formulations that used implicit contraction dynamics converged to an optimal solution in all cases for all initial guesses, with tendon force as a state generally being the fastest. Future work should focus on comparing the present approach to other approaches for computing muscle forces. The present approach lacks some of the major limitations of established methods such as static optimization and computed muscle control while remaining computationally efficient.},

Consequently, simulations require small time steps, and optimal control problems are slow to solve and have poor convergence. In this paper, we present an implicit formulation of musculoskeletal dynamics, which leads to new numerical methods for simulation and optimal control, with the expectation that we can mitigate some of these problems. A first order Rosenbrock method was developed for solving forward dynamic problems using the implicit formulation. It was used to perform real-time dynamic simulation of a complex shoulder arm system with extreme dynamic stiffness. Simulations had an RMS error of only 0.11 degrees in joint angles when running at real-time speed. For optimal control of musculoskeletal systems, a direct collocation method was developed for implicitly formulated models. The method was applied to predict gait with a prosthetic foot and ankle. Solutions were obtained in well under one hour of computation time and demonstrated how patients may adapt their gait to compensate for limitations of a specific prosthetic limb design. The optimal control method was also applied to a state estimation problem in sports biomechanics, where forces during skiing were estimated from noisy and incomplete kinematic data. Using a full musculoskeletal dynamics model for state estimation had the additional advantage that forward dynamic simulations, could be done with the same implicitly formulated model to simulate injuries and perturbation responses. While these methods are powerful and allow solution of previously intractable problems, there are still considerable numerical challenges, especially related to the convergence of gradient-based solvers.},

The results show that after extended exposure to the force field, subjects continued to move exactly as they did in the null field and thus used substantially more energy than needed. Even after practicing to move along the minimal energy path, subjects did not adapt their freely chosen hand paths to reduce energy expenditure.

The self-consistent calculation method is applied to data obtained from the gastrocnemius medialis muscle of the rat, since for such an animal model both relationships can be independently derived from a set of isotonic release contractions. For the two animals studied, the force-velocity and force-extension relationships calculated by the self-consistent method were in good agreement with the ones derived from isotonic releases performed on the same muscle. The statistical properties of the estimates obtained by the calculation method were investigated using a Monte Carlo technique. The method was found to yield results which were biased by less than 2\% and which possessed a coefficient of variation smaller than 5\%. These findings indicate that the proposed calculation method can be a useful tool for determining the contractile properties of skeletal muscle as reflected in the force-velocity and force-extension relationships.},

	abstract = {Purpose 

Relationships between tangential pedal force and crank angular velocity in sprint cycling tend to be linear. We set out to understand why they are not hyperbolic, like the intrinsic force–velocity relationship of muscles.

Methods

We simulated isokinetic sprint cycling at crank angular velocities ranging from 30 to 150 rpm with a forward dynamic model of the human musculoskeletal system actuated by eight lower extremity muscle groups. The input of the model was muscle stimulation over time, which we optimized to maximize average power output over a cycle.

Results

Peak tangential pedal force was found to drop more with crank angular velocity than expected based on intrinsic muscle properties. This linearizing effect was not due to segmental dynamics but rather due to active state dynamics. Maximizing average power in cycling requires muscles to bring their active state from as high as possible during shortening to as low as possible during lengthening. Reducing the active state is a relatively slow process, and hence must be initiated a certain amount of time before lengthening starts. As crank angular velocity goes up, this amount of time corresponds to a greater angular displacement, so the instant of switching off extensor muscle stimulation must occur earlier relative to the angle at which pedal force was extracted for the force–velocity relationship.

Conclusion

Relationships between pedal force and crank angular velocity in sprint cycling do not reflect solely the intrinsic force–velocity relationship of muscles but also the consequences of activation dynamics.},

	abstract = {Eleven men with recreational bicycling experience rode a bicycle ergometer with instrumented force pedals to determine the effects of pedalling rate and power output on the total resultant pedal force, Far, and the component of the force perpendicular to the crank arm. The force patterns were obtained at power outputs of 100 W and 200 W for pedalling rates of 40–120 rpm in intervals of 10 rpm. Data were not obtained at 40 rpm at the 200 W power output. The Far, averaged over a crank cycle (Far) was lowest at 90 rpm and 100 W, a value statistically different (P {\textless} 0.05) from those at 40, 50, and 120 rpm. At 200 W, the Far was lowest at 100 rpm, a value statistically different (P {\textless} 0.05) from those at 50, 60, and 70 rpm. The Far varied widely (range of 30\% of mean for all subjects) for individuals at a given power output. The results suggest that pedalling at 90–100 rpm may minimize peripheral forces and therefore peripheral muscle fatigue even though this rate may result in higher oxygen uptake.

	abstract = {In this study we evaluated the physiological and biomechanical responses of “elite-national class” (i.e., group 1; N = 9) and “good-state class” (i.e., group 2; N = 6) cyclists while they simulated a 40 km time-trial in the laboratory by cycling on an ergometer for 1 h at their highest power output. Actual road racing 40 km time-trial performance was highly correlated with average absolute power during the 1 h laboratory performance test (r = −0.88; P {\textless} 0.001). In turn, 1 h power output was related to each cyclists' V̇O2 at the blood lactate threshold (r = 0.93; P {\textless} 0.001). Group 1 was not different from group 2 regarding V̇O2max (approximately 70 ml·kg−1·min−1 and 5.01 l·min −1) or lean body weight. However, group 1 bicycled 40 km on the road 10\% faster than group 2 (P {\textless} 0.05; 54 vs 60 min). Additionally, group 1 was able to generate 11 \% more power during the 1 h performance test than group 2 (P {\textless} 0.05), and they averaged 90 ± 1\% V̇O2max compared with 86 ± 2\% V̇O2ma, in group 2 (P = 0.06). The higher performance power output of group 1 was produced primarily by generating higher peak torques about the center of the crank by applying larger vertical forces to the crank arm during the cycling downstroke. Compared with group 2, group 1 also produced higher peak torques and vertical forces during the downstroke even when cycling at the same absolute work rate as group 2. Factors possibly contributing to the ability of group 1 to produce higher “downstroke power” are a greater percentage of Type I muscle fibers (P {\textless} 0.05) and a 23\% greater (P {\textless} 0.05) muscle capillary density compared with group 2. We have also observed a strong relationship between years of endurance training and percent Type I muscle fibers (r = 0.75; P {\textless} 0.001). It appears that “elite-national class” cyclists have the ability to generate higher “downstroke power“, possibly as a result of muscular adaptations stimulated by more years of endurance training.

	abstract = {Whereas muscle spindles play a prominent role in current theories of human motor control, Golgi tendon organs (GTO) and their associated tendons are often neglected. This is surprising since there is ample evidence that both tendons and GTOs contribute importantly to neuromusculoskeletal dynamics. Using detailed musculoskeletal models, we provide evidence that simple feedback using muscle spindles alone results in very poor control of joint position and movement since muscle spindles cannot sense changes in tendon length that occur with changes in muscle force. We propose that a combination of spindle and GTO afferents can provide an estimate of muscle-tendon complex length, which can be effectively used for low-level feedback during both postural and movement tasks. The feasibility of the proposed scheme was tested using detailed musculoskeletal models of the human arm. Responses to transient and static perturbations were simulated using a 1-degree-of-freedom (DOF) model of the arm and showed that the combined feedback enabled the system to respond faster, reach steady state faster, and achieve smaller static position errors. Finally, we incorporated the proposed scheme in an optimally controlled 2-DOF model of the arm for fast point-to-point shoulder and elbow movements. Simulations showed that the proposed feedback could be easily incorporated in the optimal control framework without complicating the computation of the optimal control solution, yet greatly enhancing the system's response to perturbations. The theoretical analyses in this study might furthermore provide insight about the strong physiological couplings found between muscle spindle and GTO afferents in the human nervous system.},

Twelve triathletes were asked to pedal at an intensity near the ventilatory threshold (VT+?20\%) and at an intenisty corresponding to the respiratory compensation point (RCP). For each intensity, subjects were tested under three positions: (1) upright posture (UP), (2) dropped posture (DP), and (3) AP. Gas exchanges, surface electromyography and pedal effective force were continuously recorded. No significant difference was found for the gas-exchange variables among the three positions. Data illustrate a significant increase [gluteus maximus (GMax), vastus medialis (VM)] and decrease [rectus femoris (RF)] in electromyography (EMG) activity level in AP compared with UP at RCP. A significant shift forward of the EMG patterns (i.e. later onset of activation) was observed for RF (at VT+?20\% and RCP), GMax, VL, and VM (at RCP) in AP compared with UP. These EMG changes are closely related to alteration of force profile in AP (higher downstroke positive peak force, lower upstroke negative peak force, and later occurrence of these peaks along the crank cycle).},

However, empirical observations show that resultant pedal forces display substantial radial components in recreational and even highly-trained elite cyclists. Therefore, we hypothesized that attempting to maximize mechanical effectiveness during the entire downstroke of the pedal cycle must be associated with a penalty that outweighs the benefits of perfect effectiveness. Twenty recreational cyclists performed maximum isometric voluntary contractions at five static crank positions in the downstroke phase of cycling for two testing conditions: (i) a non-constrained (NC) condition, where athletes were asked to produce the maximum force possible on the pedal without consideration of the force direction and (ii) a constrained (C) condition, with the instruction to produce maximal pedal forces perpendicular to the crank. Resultant force and effective force (force perpendicular to the crank in the NC conditions) were compared to the force in the C condition that was, by definition, perpendicular to the crank. Maximum effective force in the NC condition was greater (mean = 50 \%, range = 38–69 \%) than for the C condition across all crank positions. Applying forces perpendicular to the crank in the downstroke of the pedal cycle resulted in severe reductions in force magnitude, suggesting that coaches and athletes should not attempt to change cycling technique towards perfect force effectiveness.},

	abstract = {This article presents an analytical technique for decomposing the pedal force in cycling into a muscular component due directly to the net intersegmental moments and a nonmuscular component due to gravitational and inertial effects. The decomposition technique uses the Newton-Euler system of dynamic equations for the leg segments to solve for the two components, given the planar segmental kinematics and the intersegmental moments. Applications of the technique to cycling studies of muscle function, pedalling effectiveness, and optimization analyses based on inverse dynamics are discussed. While this article focuses on the pedal force in cycling, the decomposition method can be directly applied to analyze the reaction forces during a general planar movement of the leg when the segmental kinematics and intersegmental moments are specified. This article also demonstrates the significance of the nonmuscular component relative to the muscular component by performing the decomposition of the pedal forces of an example subject who pedalled at three different cadences against a common work load. The key results were that the nonmuscular components increased in magnitude as the cadence increased, whereas the magnitude of the muscular component remained relatively constant over the majority of the crank cycle. Also, even at the slowest pedalling rate of 70 rpm, the magnitude of the nonmuscular component was substantial.},

	abstract = {We determined the index of effectiveness (IE), as defined by the ratio of the tangential (effective force) to the total force applied on the pedals, using a new method proposed by Mornieux et al. (J Biomech, 2005), while simultaneously measuring the muscular efficiency during sub-maximal cycling tests of different intensities. This allowed us to verify whether part of the changes in muscular efficiency could be explained by a better orientation of the force applied on the pedals. Ten subjects were asked to perform an incremental test to exhaustion, starting at 100 W and with 30 W increments every 5 min, at 80 rpm. Gross (GE) and net (NE) efficiencies were calculated from the oxygen uptake and WExt measurements. From the three-dimensional force’s measurements, it was possible to measure the total force (FTot), including the effective (FTang) and ineffective force (FRad+Lat). IE has been determined as the ratio between FTang and FTot, applied on the pedals for three different time intervals, i.e., during the full revolution (IE360°), the downstroke phase (IE180°Desc) and the upstroke phase (IE180°Asc). IE360° and IE180°Asc were significantly correlated with GE (r=0.79 and 0.66, respectively) and NE (r=0.66 and 0.99, respectively). In contrast, IE180°Desc was not correlated to GE or to NE. From a mechanical point of view, during the upstroke, the subject was able to reduce the non-propulsive forces applied by an active muscle contraction, contrary to the downstroke phase. As a consequence, the term ‘passive phase’, which is currently used to characterize the upstroke phase, seems to be obsolete. The IE180°Asc could also explain small variations of GE and NE for a recreational group.},

	abstract = {Efficiency, the ratio of work generated to the total metabolic energy cost, has been suggested to be a key determinant of endurance cycling performance. The purpose of this brief review is to evaluate the influence of gross efficiency on cycling power output and to consider whether or not gross efficiency can be modified. In a re-analysis of data from five separate studies, variation in gross efficiency explained {\textasciitilde}30\% of the variation in power output during cycling time-trials. Whilst other variables, notably VO2max and lactate threshold, have been shown to explain more of the variance in cycling power output, these results confirm the important influence of gross efficiency. Case study, cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention research designs have all been used to demonstrate that exercise training can enhance gross efficiency. Whilst improvements have been seen with a wide range of training types (endurance, strength, altitude), it would appear that high intensity training is the most potent stimulus for changes in gross efficiency. In addition to physiological adaptations, gross efficiency might also be improved through biomechanical adaptations. However, ‘intuitive’ technique and equipment adjustments may not always be effective. For example, whilst ‘pedalling in circles’ allows pedalling to become mechanically more effective, this technique does not result in short term improvements in gross efficiency.\&lt;br /\&gt;},

	abstract = {The effect of fatigue as a result of a standard submaximal dynamic exercise on maximal short-term power output generated at different contraction velocities was studied in humans. Six subjects performed 25-s maximal efforts on an isokinetic cycle ergometer at five different pedaling rates (60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 rpm). Measurements of maximal power output were made under control conditions [after 6 min of cycling at 30\% maximal O2 uptake (VO2max)] and after fatiguing exercise that consisted of 6 min of cycling at 90\% VO2max with a pedaling rate of 90 rpm. Compared with control values, maximal peak power measured after fatiguing exercise was significantly reduced by 23 +/- 19, 28 +/- 11, and 25 +/- 11\% at pedaling rates of 90, 105, and 120 rpm, respectively. Reductions in maximum peak power of 11 +/- 8 and 14 +/- 8\% at 60 and 75 rpm, respectively, were not significant. The rate of decline in peak power during the 25-s control measurement was least at 60 rpm (5.1 +/- 2.3 W/s) and greatest at 120 rpm (26.3 +/- 13.9 W/s). After fatiguing exercise, the rate of decline in peak power at pedaling rates of 105 and 120 rpm decreased significantly from 21.5 +/- 9.0 and 26.3 +/- 13.9 W/s to 10.0 +/- 7.3 and 13.3 +/- 6.9 W/s, respectively. These experiments indicate that fatigue induced by submaximal dynamic exercise results in a velocity-dependent effect on muscle power. It is suggested that the reduced maximal power at the higher velocities was due to a selective effect of fatigue on the faster fatigue-sensitive fibers of the active muscle mass.},

Twenty male, non-professional cyclists were randomly assigned into intervention and control group, training 5 weeks with SmartCranks and conventional cranks, respectively. Before and after the training period the subjects performed an incremental test to exhaustion. Lactate was measured to determine the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) and forces at the pedal were recorded to quantify changes in the work distribution over the full revolution. We observed no significant statistical difference for peak power (PO; 333.3 ± 32.8 W vs. 323.3 ± 21.8 W) and PO at IAT (229.6 ± 30.1 W vs. 222.7 ± 25.2 W) for SmartCrank and control conditions, respectively (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, we did observe that work distribution in the downward phase was significantly reduced in the SmartCranks training group at peak PO (from 70.0 ± 4.9\% to 64.3 ± 5.8\%; P {\textless} 0.05). Although the possible implications of the change in the work distribution of sectors are not known, for the success in cycling performance—indicated by the PO—training with the SmartCranks was not more advantageous than training with conventional bicycle cranks.},

Experiments yielded the following major conclusions: (1) Using cleated shoes retards fatigue of the quadriceps muscle group. By allowing more flexor muscle utilization during the backstroke, cleated shoes distribute the workload and alleviate the peak load demand on the quadriceps group; (2) overall pedalling efficiency increases with power level; (3) non-motive load components which apply adverse moments on the knee joint are of significant magnitude; (4) analysis of pedalling is an invaluable training aid.

Index of pedalling effectiveness was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) improved during FB (41.4±5.5\%); compared with PT (36.6±4.1\%). Prolonged cycling induced a significant reduction of maximal power output, which was greater after PT (?15±9\%) than after FB (?7±12\%). During steady-state FB, vastus lateralis muscle activity was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced, whereas biceps femoris muscles activities increased compared with PT.

The relationship between cadence and both FE and GE, within and between subjects, was very similar, irrespective of FCC. There was no difference between level and inclined cycling position. The seat adjustments did not affect FE, DC and GE or the relationship between them. Energy expenditure is strongly coupled to cadence, but force effectiveness, as a measure for pedalling technique, is not likely the cause of this relationship. FE, DC and GE are not affected by body orientation or seat adjustments, indicating that these parameters and the relationship between them are robust to coordinative challenges within a range of cadence, body orientation and seat position that is used in regular cycling.},

These characterizations require large numbers of data points because both what type of function (e.g., linear, exponential, hyperbolic) best represents each property, and the values of the parameters in the relevant equations, need to be determined. Only a few properties are therefore generally measured in experiments on any one muscle, and complete characterizations are obtained by averaging data across a large number of muscles. Such averaging approaches can work well for muscles that are similar across individuals. However, considerable evidence indicates that large inter-individual variation exists, at least for some muscles. This variation poses difficulties for across-animal averaging approaches. Methods to fully describe all muscle’s characteristics in experiments on individual muscles would therefore be useful. Prior work in stick insect extensor muscle has identified what functions describe each of this muscle’s properties and shown that these equations apply across animals. Characterizing these muscles on an individual-by-individual basis therefore requires determining only the values of the parameters in these equations, not equation form. We present here techniques that allow determining all these parameter values in experiments on single muscles. This technique will allow us to compare parameter variation across individuals and to model muscles individually. Similar experiments can likely be performed on single muscles in other systems. This approach may thus provide a widely applicable method for characterizing and modeling muscles from single experiments.},

In other words, he assumed that the active muscle behaved as a stretched spring and that the tension-length curve of a given muscle, under a definite set of external conditions, was invariable and independent of the particular way in which it was obtained. This assumption was shown to be erroneous by Blix (2), with the help of his myographion, by means of which tension-length diagrams both of shortening, and of stretched, muscle could be automatically recorded. Blix showed that, at any length, tension developed during stretch was greater than corresponding tension developed during release. This observation was confirmed and extended by Fick (3, 4), who at first assumed an increased “physiological” response in stretch as the cause of this effect. In order to measure this response he determined the total energy of a contraction, this term denoting the algebraic sum of mechanical work and heat produced by the muscle. This quantity was found to be smaller in the case of a stretched muscle, and no satisfactory explanation was available capable of fitting the more elaborate picture which had emerged, largely from Fick’s hands.},

The force-velocity (P-V) relation for normal or NO-3 treated single fibres isolated from the semitendinosus muscle of the frog was determined at given times during the rise of tension and the plateau of isometric tetani. Experiments were made at about 2.25 micron sarcomere length and at constant temperatures, from 3 to 4.5 degrees C and from 19 to 21 degrees C. The controlled-velocity release method was used. 2. During the rise of tension, at any initial tension higher than about 0.2 P0, the lowest release velocity required to drop the tension to zero was the same as at the tetanic plateau, independent of the temperature and the presence of NO-3 ions in the bathing solution. 3. The degree of activation (measured by the steady force exerted at a given velocity of shortening lower than V0) increased with time, but attained its steady-state level before isometric tension. 4. At about 20 degrees C, frog muscle fibres at about 2.2 micron sarcomere length were only partially activated after a single stimulus. 5. NO-3 ions did not affect the steady-state P-V relation. At about 20 degrees C, NO-3 ions increased the rate of development of activation. Potentiation of the twitch contraction was due at least in part to this mechanism. 6. The 'relative' P-V relation appears to be independent of both the time after start of stimulation and the presence of NO-3 ions in the bathing solution. 7.

	abstract = {The hope was recently expressed (Hill 1937, p. 116) that with the development of a more accurate and rapid technique for muscle heat measurement, a much more consistent picture might emerge of the energy relations of muscles shortening (or lengthening) and doing positive (or negative) work. This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called “visco-elasticity” of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the “visco-elastic” properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.},

This work summarizes the sagittal hip, knee, and ankle joint biomechanics for a broad range of daily movements, based on previously published literature, to identify requirements for robotic design. Maximum joint power, moment, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, as well as the movement-related range of motion and the mean absolute power were extracted, compared, and analyzed for essential and sportive movement tasks. We found that the full human range of motion is required to mimic human like performance and versatility. In general, sportive movements were found to exhibit the highest joint requirements in angular velocity, angular acceleration, moment, power, and mean absolute power. However, at the hip, essential movements, such as recovery, had comparable or even higher requirements. Further, we found that the moment and power demands were generally higher in stance, while the angular velocity and angular acceleration were mostly higher or equal in swing compared to stance for locomotion tasks. The extracted requirements provide a novel comprehensive overview that can help with the dimensioning of actuators enabling tailored assistance or rehabilitation for wearable lower limb robots, and to achieve essential, sportive or augmented performances that exceed natural human capabilities with humanoid robots.},

Such measurements have often taken the form of the maximum voluntary torque at a single joint angle and angular velocity. However, the available strength varies substantially with joint position and velocity. When examining dynamic activities, strength measurements should account for these variations. A model is presented of maximum voluntary joint torque as a function of joint angle and angular velocity. The model is based on well-known physiological relationships between muscle force and length and between muscle force and velocity and was tested by fitting it to maximum voluntary joint torque data from six different exertions in the lower limb. Isometric, concentric and eccentric maximum voluntary contractions were collected during hip extension, hip flexion, knee extension, knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Model parameters are reported for each of these exertion directions by gender and age group. This model provides an efficient method by which strength variations with joint angle and angular velocity may be incorporated into comparisons between joint torques calculated by inverse dynamics and the maximum available joint torques.},

The information needed to calculate the combined effect of both patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joint on the mechanical advantage of the muscle was obtained from lateral-view radiographs of autopsy knees.The results show that the smallest quadriceps force (2,000 N) is exerted at maximal extension, and the largest force (8,000 N) at about 75° of flexion. The patellar ligament force reaches a maximum (5,000 N) at 60°. The reaction force in the patellofemoral joint is the smallest (1,000 N) at extension and is of the same values as the muscle force in a range from 75 to 90°. Especially at large flexion angles, the value of the estimated forces is considerably larger (by 100\%) than reported in the literature.

There was marked uniformity of fiber length throughout a given muscle and a trend toward similar fiber lengths within muscles of a synergistic group. Muscle length/fiber length ratios were remarkably similar for all three limbs. Angles of fiber pinnation were relatively small (0°-15°) and generally consistent throughout the muscle. From these architectural data, the performance of a muscle was studied with respect to its tension production and velocity of shortening potentials. The tension is a function of the number of sarcomeres in parallel, and the velocity of shortening is a function of the number of sarcomeres in series. Muscles were grouped according to whether they showed a predilection for tension or velocity of shortening.

Architectural values are used to model muscle-joint behavior and to make surgical decisions. The two most extensively used human lower extremity data sets consist of five total specimens of unknown size, gender, and age. Therefore, it is critically important to generate a high-fidelity human lower extremity muscle architecture data set. We disassembled 27 muscles from 21 human lower extremities to characterize muscle fiber length and physiologic cross-sectional area, which define the excursion and force-generating capacities of a muscle. Based on their architectural features, the soleus, gluteus medius, and vastus lateralis are the strongest muscles, whereas the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus have the largest excursion. The plantarflexors, knee extensors, and hip adductors are the strongest muscle groups acting at each joint, whereas the hip adductors and hip extensors have the largest excursion. Contrary to previous assertions, two-joint muscles do not necessarily have longer fibers than single-joint muscles as seen by the similarity of knee flexor and extensor fiber lengths. These high-resolution data will facilitate the development of more accurate musculoskeletal models and challenge existing theories of muscle design; we believe they will aid in surgical decision making.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 

We hypothesized that the initial rate (first 40 ms) of unilateral knee extensor torque development during a maximally fast isometric contraction would depend on the subjects' ability for fast neural activation and that it would predict bilateral jumping performance.

Methods:

Nine males (21.8 ± 0.9 yr, means ± SD) performed unilateral fast isometric knee extensions (120° knee angle) without countermovement on a dynamometer and bilateral squat jumps (SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ) starting from 90 and 120° knee angles (full extension = 180°). The dynamometer contractions started either from full relaxation or from an isometric pre-tension (15\% maximal isometric torque, Tmax). Torque time integral for the first 40 ms after torque onset (TTI-40, normalized to Tmax) and averaged normalized rectified knee extensor EMG for 40 ms before fast torque onset (EMG-40) were used to quantify initial torque rise and voluntary muscle activation.

Results:

TTI-40 without pre-tension (range: 0.02-0.19\% Tmax per second) was significantly lower than TTI-40 with pre-tension, and both were significantly (r = 0.81 and 0.80) related to EMG-40. During jumping, similar significant positive relations were found between jump height and knee extensor EMG during the first 100 ms of the rise in ground reaction force. There also were significant positive linear relations between dynamometer TTI-40 and jump height (r = 0.75 (SJ 90), 0.84 (SJ 120), 0.76 (CMJ 90), and 0.86 (CMJ 120)) but not between dynamometer Tmax and jump height (−0.16 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.02).

Conclusion:

One-legged TTI-40 to a large extent explained the variation in jump height. The ability to produce a high efferent neural drive before muscle contraction seemed to dominate performance in both the simple single-joint isometric task and the complex multijoint dynamic task.},

Purpose

Muscular power produced during in vitro cyclic contraction has been reported to vary with muscle-length trajectory. The purpose of this study was to determine whether maximal human single-leg cycling power could be similarly altered by manipulating pedal trajectory.

Method

Seven trained cyclists performed maximal single-leg cycle ergometry. Pedal trajectory was manipulated by repositioning the ergometer drive sprocket off-center with respect to the crank axle, such that the leg-extension phase occupied 42, 50, or 58\% of the cycle time (LEP42, LEP50, and LEP58, respectively).

Results

Maximum instantaneous power was 12\% greater for LEP58 (1984 ± 143 W) than LEP50 (1838 ± 126 W), which was 8\% greater than that for LEP42 (1645 ± 112 W). Maximum power, averaged over a complete revolution of the crank, was 4\% greater for LEP58 (636 ± 59 W) than for LEP50 (613 ± 53 W), which was 18\% greater than that for LEP42 (520 ± 43 W).

Conclusions

These findings, paralleling those for an in vitro model, confirmed our hypothesis that maximal single-leg cycling power could be altered by manipulating pedal trajectory. Alterations in power were likely due to concomitant effects of muscle-shortening velocity, muscle excitation, and biomechanical constraints. Additional research is needed to determine whether greater leg-extension phase ratios can elicit further increases in power and whether similar results can be obtained during bilateral cycling.},

We applied this approach to estimate the mechanical work in cross-country skiing and to identify the fundamental mechanisms of this particular form of locomotion. We acquired movements of body segments, skis, poles and plantar pressures for eight skiers while they roller skied on a treadmill at 14 km h−1 and a 2 deg slope using three different techniques (diagonal stride, DS; double poling, DP; double poling with kick, DK). The work associated with kinetic energy (KE) changes of COM was not different between techniques; the work against gravity associated with potential energy (PE) changes was higher for DP than for DK and was lowest for DS. Mechanical work against the external environment was 0.87 J m−1 kg−1 for DS, 0.70 J m−1 kg−1 for DP and 0.79 J m−1 kg−1 for DK. The work done to overcome frictional forces, which is negligible in walking and running, was 17.8\%, 32.3\% and 24.8\% of external mechanical work for DS, DP and DK, respectively. The pendulum-like recovery (R\%) between PE and KE was {\textasciitilde}45\%, {\textasciitilde}26\% and {\textasciitilde}9\% for DP, DK and DS, respectively, but energy losses by friction are not accounted for in this computation. The pattern of fluctuations of PE and KE indicates that DS can be described as a ‘grounded running’, where aerial phases are substituted by ski gliding phases, DP can be described as a pendular gait, whereas DK is a combination of both.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that muscle fibers become more sensitive for [Ca2+] with increasing sarcomere length. In mechanical terms this length-dependent [Ca2+] sensitivity (LDCS) adds to the stiffness of muscle fibers, because muscle force, normalized for the force–length relationship at maximal stimulation, increases with contractile element (CE) length. Although LDCS is well-documented in the physiological literature, it is ignored in most motor control studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the importance of LDCS as a contributor to the stiffness of a muscle. Comparison of experimental data with predictions derived from the model of activation dynamics proposed by Hatze (Myocybernetic Control Models of Skeletal Muscle, University of South Africa, Pretoria, 1981, pp. 31–42) indicated that this model captures the main characteristics of LDCS well. It was shown that LDCS accounts for the experimentally observed shifts in optimum length at sub-maximal stimulation levels. Furthermore, it was shown that in conditions with low-to-medium muscle stimulation, the contribution of LDCS to the total amount of stiffness provided by the muscle is substantial. It was concluded that LDCS is an important muscle property and should be taken into account in studies concerning motor control.},

The fibers were first activated in Ca2+- or Sr2+-buffered solutions under near-physiological conditions, and then their MHC isoform composition was determined electrophoretically. Fibers expressing only the MHC I isoform could be appropriately identified on the basis of either the Ca2+- or Sr2+-activation characteristics or the MHC isoform composition. Fibers expressing one or a combination of fast MHC isoforms displayed no significant differences in their Ca2+- or Sr2+-activation properties; therefore, their MHC isoform composition could not be predicted from their Ca2+- or Sr2+-activation characteristics. A large proportion of fibers expressing both fast- and slow-twitch MHC isoforms displayed Ca2+- or Sr2+-activation properties that were not consistent with their MHC isoform composition; thus both fiber-typing methods were needed to fully characterize such fibers. These data show that, in rat skeletal muscles, the extent of correlation between MHC isoform expression and Ca2+- or Sr2+-activation characteristics is fiber-type dependent.},

The present study investigates effects of such epimuscular myofascial force transmission in the rat calf muscles. Unlike previous approaches, we quantified the mechanical interaction between the soleus (SO) and the lateral gastrocnemius and plantaris complex (LG+PL) applying a set of muscle lengths and relative positions corresponding to the range of knee and ankle angles occurring during normal movements. In nine deeply anesthetized Wistar rats, the superficial posterior crural compartment was exposed, and distal and proximal tendons of LG+PL and the distal SO tendon were severed and connected to force transducers. The target muscles were excited simultaneously. We found that SO active and passive tendon force was substantially affected by proximally lengthening of LG+PL mimicking knee extension (10\% and 0.8\% of maximal active SO force, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, SO relative position significantly changed the LG+PL length-force relationship, resulting in nonunique values for passive slack-length and optimum-length estimates. We conclude that also, for physiological muscle conditions, isometric force of rat triceps surae muscles is determined by its muscle-tendon unit length as well as by the length and relative position of its synergists. This has implications for understanding the neuromechanics of skeletal muscle in normal and pathological conditions, as well as for studies relying on the assumption that muscles act as independent force actuators.},

	abstract = {The classical view of muscles as independent motors has been challenged over the past decades. An alternative view has emerged in which muscles are not isolated but embedded in a three-dimensional connective tissue network that links them to adjacent muscles and other non-muscular structures in the body. Animal studies showing that the forces measured at the distal and proximal ends of a muscle are not equal have provided undisputable evidence that these connective tissue linkages are strong enough to serve as an extra pathway for muscular force transmission. In this historical review, we first introduce the terminology and anatomy related to these pathways of muscle force transmission and provide a definition for the term epimuscular force transmission. We then focus on important experimental evidence indicating mechanical interactions between synergistic muscles that may affect force transmission and/or influence the muscles’ force generating capacity. We illustrate that there may exist different expressions of the highly relevant force–length properties depending on whether the force is measured at the proximal or distal tendon and depending on the dynamics of surrounding structures. Changes in length, activation level or disruption of the connective tissue of neighboring muscles, can affect how muscles interact and produce force on the skeleton. While most direct evidence is from animal experiments, studies on humans also suggest functional implications of the connective tissues surrounding muscles. These implications may explain how distant segments, which are not part of the same joint system, affect force generation at a given joint, and, in clinical conditions, explain observations from tendon transfer surgeries, where a muscle transferred to act as an antagonist continues to produce agonistic moments.},

Steady-state force?pCa relations were determined for mechanically skinned fibres of fast- and slow-twitch rat skeletal muscle, extensor digitorum longus (e.d.l.) and soleus respectively, at varied sarcomere lengths and temperatures (3-35 °C). 2. This relation was different for the two fibre types at all sarcomere lengths, with soleus fibres having lower Ca2+ concentration threshold for activation and requiring a wider Ca2+ concentration range to reach force saturation. 3. An increase in sarcomere length within the range 2·2-3·6 ?m reversibly shifted the steady-state force?pCa curves for both fast- and slow-twitch fibres toward lower Ca2+ without affecting the steepness of the curves. 4. The results are consistent with the idea that the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ca2+ is increased with increasing sarcomere length. 5. The change in apparent Ca2+ sensitivity (measured as the change in pCa corresponding to 50\% Ca-activated force (?pCa50)) was approximately proportional to the change in sarcomere length (?SL) at all temperatures for both types of muscle fibre. 6. The proportionality coefficient (?pCa50/?SL) was higher for slow-twitch fibres than for fast-twitch fibres by a factor of 1·5-2·0 at all temperatures investigated. 7. The force?pCa relation was less affected by changes in sarcomere length at lower (3-5 °C) than at higher temperatures (22-35 °C). 8. The sarcomere length?maximum force relation obtained with skinned fibres for sarcomere lengths between 2·10 and 4·05 ?m was similar for both fibre types at all temperatures despite large temperature dependent variations in maximum Ca-activated force response. Maximum force decreased linearly to zero between ca. 2·8 and 3·95 ?m; remained high and essentially constant between ca. 2·40 and 2·80 ?m, and decreased significantly below 2·40 ?m. 9. Myofilament-generated tension oscillations produced by partially activated soleus skinned fibres are highly length dependent, disappearing completely when sarcomere length is increased above 3·15 ?m.},

By subdividing ventral roots and supplying stimulating pulses to different groups of motor units in rotation, smooth contractions of soleus could be obtained with low rates of stimulation. 2. Isometric tension was recorded with different rates of stimulation, and at different muscle lengths. 3. Longitudinal histological sections were cut from muscles fixed at different lengths, and sarcomeres were measured. Mean sarcomere lengths in soleus could then be related to the angle at the ankle. 4. At high rates of stimulation the maximum active tension was obtained at a length corresponding to an angle of about 60° at the ankle, and a mean sarcomere length of about 2·8 ?. The isometric tension fell only slightly on shortening the muscle to a length equivalent to 100°, and a mean sarcomere length about 2·3 ?. Further shortening caused a marked fall in tension. 5. There was a reciprocal relationship between stimulus rate and muscle length; when the muscle was long low rates of stimulation gave near maximal tension, whereas at short lengths the maximum tension was reached only when the stimulus rate was very high. It is suggested that stimulating pulses activate the contractile machinery of the muscle more effectively at long than at short muscle lengths. 6. When at low rates of stimulation pulses were distributed among the motor units in rotation to give a smooth contraction, the tension rose higher than during the unfused tetanus that accompanied synchronous stimulation of the same motor units at the same rate. It is suggested that in an unfused tetanus internal movement of the muscle reduces the tension below that developed in a truly isometric state. 7. The rate of rise of tension in an isometric tetanus varied with both muscle length and rate of stimulation. At each stimulus rate there was a range of lengths in which the isometric tension developed slowly, this was the same length range in which, at that stimulus rate, the length tension curve was steep.},

	abstract = {Explosive movements such as throwing, kicking, and jumping are characterized by high velocity and short movement time. Due to the fact that latencies of neural feedback loops are long in comparison to movement times, correction of deviations cannot be achieved on the basis of neural feedback. In other words, the control signals must be largely preprogrammed. Furthermore, in many explosive movements the skeletal system is mechanically analogous to an inverted pendulum; in such a system, disturbances tend to be amplified as time proceeds. It is difficult to understand how an inverted-pendulum-like system can be controlled on the basis of some form of open loop control (albeit during a finite period of time only). To investigate if actuator properties, specifically the force-length-velocity relationship of muscle, reduce the control problem associated with explosive movement tasks such as human vertical jumping, a direct dynamics modeling and simulation approach was adopted. In order to identify the role of muscle properties, two types of open loop control signals were applied: STIM(t), representing the stimulation of muscles, and MOM(t), representing net joint moments. In case of STIM control, muscle properties influence the joint moments exerted on the skeleton; in case of MOM control, these moments are directly prescribed. By applying perturbations and comparing the deviations from a reference movement for both types of control, the reduction of the effect of disturbances due to muscle properties was calculated. It was found that the system is very sensitive to perturbations in case of MOM control; the sensitivity to perturbations is markedly less in case of STIM control. It was concluded that muscle properties constitute a peripheral feedback system that has the advantage of zero time delay. This feedback system reduces the effect of perturbations during human vertical jumping to such a degree that when perturbations are not too large, the task may be performed successfully without any adaptation of the muscle stimulation pattern.},

Introduction

Mechanical power output in sprint cycling depends on pedaling rate, with an optimum at around 130 revolutions per minute (rpm). In this study, the question is addressed if this optimal pedaling rate can be understood from a Hill-type description of muscular dynamics. In particular, it is investigated how 1) the power–velocity relationship that follows from Hill’s force-velocity relationship and 2) activation dynamics (from the perspective of which the optimal pedaling rate is near-zero) affect the optimal pedaling rate.

Methods

A forward dynamics modeling/simulation approach is adopted in this study. The skeletal model is a 2D linkage of rigid segments; it is actuated by eight Hill-type “muscles.” Input of the model is the neural stimulation of the muscles, output is the resulting movement and variables dependent thereupon, such as pedal forces. For a wide range of isokinetic pedaling rates, the neural stimulation is optimized with respect to the average mechanical power output.

Results

Correspondence between experimental data and simulation results regarding 1) the (pedaling-rate dependent) muscle phasing, 2) pedal forces, and 3) the power-pedaling rate relationship is good. At the optimal pedaling rate predicted by the model (120 rpm), muscles contract at velocities well below those that maximize their power output. Finally, when a model is considered that lacks activation dynamics, it is found that both the optimal pedaling rate and the maximal power output increase substantially.

Discussion

From the results pertaining to the standard model, it is concluded that the optimal pedaling rate is not uniquely specified by the power–velocity relationship of muscle, as suggested in literature. From the results pertaining to the model lacking activation dynamics, it follows that activation dynamics plays a surprisingly large role in determining the optimal pedaling rate. It is concluded that the pedaling rate that maximizes mechanical power output in sprint cycling follows from the interaction between activation dynamics and Hill’s power–velocity relationship.},

	abstract = {Humans and birds use very different running styles. Unlike humans, birds adopt ?grounded running? at intermediate speeds?a running gait where at least one foot always maintains ground contact. Avian grounded running is a paradox: Animals usually minimize locomotor energy expenditure, but birds prefer grounded running despite incurring higher energy costs. Using predictive gait simulations of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), we resolve this paradox by demonstrating that grounded running represents an optimal gait for birds, from both energetics and muscle excitations perspectives. Our virtual experiments decoupled effects of posture and tendon elasticity, biomechanically relevant anatomical features that cannot be isolated in real birds. The avian body plan prevents (near) vertical leg postures, making the running style used by humans impossible. Under this anatomical constraint, grounded running is optimal if the muscles produce the highest forces in crouched postures, as is true in most birds. Shared anatomical features suggest that, as a behavior, avian grounded running first evolved within non-avian dinosaurs. Physics simulations reveal why birds use grounded running, a running style that seemingly wastes energy.},

The purpose of this study was to challenge the nation that the relationship of moment of force to angular velocity, determined in isokinetic knee extension tests, reflects the force-velocity relationship of human knee extensors. For this purpose, maximum-effort isometric knee extension moments were collected at seven different knee joint angles, and maximum-effort isokinetic knee extension moments were measured as a function of knee joint angle at angular velocities of 30, 60, 120, and 210°-s−1. For the isokinetic contractions two protocols were used with a different threshold moment, i.e., the minimum knee extension moment that had to be reached isometrically before knee extension was initiated. In one protocol (LTM, for low threshold moment) the threshold was set at 5\% of the maximum isometric knee extension moment produced at the starting angle of 85° (180° being full knee extension), in the second protocol (HTM, for high threshold moment) it was set at 95\% of this isometric moment. During all contractions, electromyograms were recorded from m. vastus medialis, m. vastus lateralis, m. rectus femoris, and m. biceps femoris. The EMG signals were rectified and smoothed to yield SREMG. Two hypotheses were specifically tested. The first was that the threshold moment does not affect knee extension moments in the middle of the range of motion. Between knee angles of 100° and 145°, no difference were found between moments produced in the HTM protocol and those produced in the LTM protocol. Thus, the first hypothesis was supported. The second hypothesis was that subjects achieve the same level of muscle excitation at different speeds. Beyond a knee angle of 100°, SREMG levels were found to attain significantly higher values at 120 and 210° ·s−1. Thus, the second hypothesis was rejected. It was concluded that the moment-angular velocity relationship determined in isokinetic knee extension tests does not reflect solely the force-velocity relationship of human knee extensors but also includes an activation element. As long as it is unknown how variations in SREMG should be accounted for, the value of moment-angular velocity relationships for calculation of dynamic properties of human muscle groups remains questionable.

	abstract = {Fascicle length of m. vastus lateralis in cyclists has been shown to correlate positively with peak sprint cycling power normalized for lean body mass. We investigated whether vasti morphology affects sprint cycling power via force-length and force-velocity relationships. We simulated isokinetic sprint cycling at pedaling rates ranging from 40 to 150 rpm with a forward dynamic model of the human musculoskeletal system actuated by eight leg muscles. Input of the model was muscle stimulation over time, which was optimized to maximize the average power output over a pedal cycle. This was done for a reference model and for models in which the vasti had equal volume but different morphology. It was found that models with longer muscle fibers but a reduced physiological cross-sectional area of the vasti produced a higher sprint cycling power. This was partly explained by better alignment of the peak power-pedaling rate curve of the vasti with the corresponding curves of the other leg muscles. The highest sprint cycling power was achieved in a model in which the increase in muscle fiber length of the vasti was accompanied by a concomitant shift in optimum knee angle. It was concluded that muscle mechanics can partly explain the positive correlations between fascicle length of m. vastus lateralis and normalized peak sprint cycling power. It should be investigated whether muscle fiber length of the vasti and optimum knee angle are suitable training targets for athletes who want to concurrently improve their sprint and endurance cycling performance.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We simulated isokinetic sprint cycling at pedaling rates ranging from 40 to 150 rpm with a forward dynamic model of the human musculoskeletal system actuated by eight leg muscles.

Collectively, these studies indicate that the ratio of strength between the knee flexors and extensors is a function of test speed, with the ratio increasing at the faster test speeds. Unfortu nately, these studies have employed the peak torque isokinetic method for making measurements. This tech nique suffers from a number of problems that are biomechanical and physiological in nature. Conse quently, in this study, we employed comparisons of the in vivo force-velocity relationship using an angle-specific method and a gravitational correction factor to more accurately determine flexor-extensor ratios and to bet ter describe any variations occurring as a function of test speed. Nine male subjects volunteered to partici pate in this study. Each of the subjects participated in two test sessions. Subjects were tested at six angular velocities of 0, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240 deg/sec. At these respective test speeds, the mean flexor torques were 95.0, 94.8, 84.1, 66.2, 56.2, and 49.2 Nm, respectively. The corresponding values for the knee extensors were 252.2, 246.5, 220.7, 184.5, 161.9, and 146.4 Nm. Normalization of these torque-velocity relationships demonstrated that the in vivo force-velocity relation ships of the two muscle groups are similar at slow speeds, but become disparate at higher velocities. When examining flexor-extensor torque ratios at the various test speeds, it was found that there were significant differences (P {\textless} 0.01).

Purpose:

The purpose of this study was to compare electromyographic (EMG) activity and joint moment of agonists and antagonists between isokinetic eccentric and concentric knee muscle actions.

Methods:

Twelve females (20.5 ± 2.9 yr) performed maximum knee extension and flexion effort on a Biodex dynamometer isometrically and at concentric and eccentric angular velocities ranging from 30°·s−1 to 150·s−1. EMG activity of vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and hamstrings was also recorded. The moment and agonist EMG values were normalized as a percentage of the maximum isometric values. The antagonist EMG was normalized as a percentage of the IEMG activity of the same muscle group when acting as agonist at the same angular velocity and angular position and taking into consideration the effects of muscle action.

Results:

Three-way ANOVA designs indicated significantly greater normalized eccentric moments compared with concentric moments (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas the eccentric normalized integrated EMG (IEMG) of agonists and antagonists was significantly lower compared with the respective concentric IEMG values (P {\textless} 0.05). These differences were more evident at fast angular velocities.

Conclusions:

The present results demonstrate that neural activation and the resulting muscular action are different between isokinetic eccentric and concentric tests and depend also on the angular velocity of the movement. The antagonist IEMG activity is different depending on the muscle examined. The IEMG activity of the antagonists in this study indicate that the antagonist activity is an important factor that affects the resultant joint moment during isolated isokinetic maximum voluntary joint movements.},

	abstract = {To prevent the tip of the blade from scratching through the ice, the technique in speed skating requires that plantar flexion is largely suppressed during the gliding push off. This not only prevents the plantar flexors from contributing to external work but also causes the skater to lose contact with the ice long before the knee is fully extended. To prevent these disadvantages of the gliding technique, a new skate was developed that permits the shoe to rotate relative to the blade in a hinge between shoe and blade. In a case control study the progression between the 1993/1994 and 1994/1995 skating seasons of 11 male skaters from a regional junior selection who consented to switch to this new skate was compared with the progression of 72 skaters of this and all other regional and national male junior selections of The Netherlands. The experimental group appeared to improve their personal best times by 6.2 ± 2.3\%, which is a significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) larger progress than the 2.5 ± 1.6\% improvement of the control group. The new skate will therefore most likely add a new dimension to the art of speed skating.},

	abstract = {Electromyography (EMG) was used to study the role of antagonist cocontration of the hamstring muscles of 24 normal subjects during constant velocity muscle performance tests on a KINCOM™ dynamometer. The hypothesis tests whether antagonist cocontraction varies dependent on joint angle, limb velocity, and type of contraction. Seated subjects performed two dynamic tests of resisted quadriceps muscle shortening and lengthening through a 65° range of knee motion under two constant velocity conditions in a single session. Each test consisted of four repetitions of maximum effort constant velocity muscle shortening and lengthening of the knee extensors; one test performed at 30° s−1, the other at 90° s−1. The sequence of velocity testing was randomized. Normalized values of peak amplitude EMG of knee flexors were measured every 5° in the constant velocity phase of each test and compared in a paired manner between each angle, contraction type, and velocity, by split-plot 2-way ANOVA. Antagonist hamstrings cocontraction was found to be contraction type, and velocity dependent. Cocontraction was greater at larger angles of knee flexion and at higher velocity. These results do not support the hypothesis that such activity is a function of muscle moment-arm, but are consistent with the idea that antagonist muscle function is controlled by muscle spindles and perhaps Golgi tendon organs. Because antagonist cocontraction ranged up to a mean of 32\% of maximum agonist activity in normal individuals, it should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical muscle performance tests.},

Fourteen male subjects performed maximal voluntary eccentric and concentric constant-velocity knee extensions at 45, 90, 180 and 360° · s−1. Myoelectric signals were recorded, using surface electrodes, from the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles. For comparison, torque and full-wave rectified EMG signals were amplitude-averaged through the central half (30°–70°) of the range of motion. For each test velocity, eccentric torque was greater than concentric torque (range of mean differences: 20\%–146\%,P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, EMG activity for all muscles was lower under eccentric loading than velocity-matched concentric loading (7\%–31\%,P {\textless} 0.05). Neither torque output nor EMG activity for the three muscles changed across eccentric test velocities (P {\textgreater} 0.05). While concentric torque increased with decreasing velocity, EMG activity for all muscles decreased with decreasing velocity (P {\textless} 0.05). These data suggest that under certain high-tension loading conditions (especially during eccentric muscle actions), the neural drive to the agonist muscles was reduced, despite maximal voluntary effort. This may protect the musculoskeletal system from an injury that could result if the muscle was to become fully activated under these conditions.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users. A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996–1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club ({\textgreater}100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG.},

The optimal cycling frequency, that frequency at which mechanical power output is maximal, increases with temperature from 3.3Hz at 15°C to 20.1Hz at 42°C. Maximum power output increases with temperature, from 20 W kg-1 at 15°C to 154 W kg-1 at 42°C, the largest power output yet measured using the work-loop technique. At low temperatures (15°C and 22°C), stride frequency during burst running is nearly identical to the optimal cycling frequency for in vitro power output, suggesting that maximum power output may limit hindlimb cycle frequency in vivo. However, at higher temperatures (35°C and 42°C), the optimal cycling frequency of the isolated muscle is significantly higher than the burst stride frequency, demonstrating that contractile events no longer limit hindlimb cycle frequency. At higher temperatures, it is thus unlikely that the fast-twitch fibres of this muscle in vivo attain their potential for maximum power output.},

At 40°C VR was 4.3±0.2 m/s and f was 13.5±0.5 s−1.3.Between 25 and 40°C, the thermal dependencies of VR and f were approximately constant (Q10's of 1.31 and 1.36 for VR and f, respectively). Below 25°C performance declined more markedly with decreasing temperature. At 20°C strides were qualitatively normal, but VR was only half of the value at 25°C. At 15°C the lizards were substantially incapacitated, and VR was 10\% of the value at 20°C. Stride length was approximately 0.33m and changed very little withTb from 20–44°C.4.The time dependent contractile properties of FG muscle were affected more by temperature than was sprint performance. The maximal velocity of shortening at zero load (Vo) was 18.7 l0/s at 40°C and had a Q10 of 1.7 from 25–40°C. Maximal power output (\$\${\textbackslash}dot W\_\{max\} \$\$) determined from the forcevelocity curve was 464 W/kg at 40°C. Below 40°C\$\${\textbackslash}dot W\_\{max\} \$\$varied with temperature with a Q10 of 2–3. The shape of the force-velocity curve changed little with temperature (\$\${\textbackslash}dot W\_\{max\} \$\$/POVO=0.11).5.Between 25 and 40°C a relatively temperature-independent process must modulate the effects of temperature on the contractile properties of the muscles that supply the power for burst locomotion. Storage and recovery of elastic energy appears to be a likely candidate for such a process.6.Below 25°C, however, the contraction time is prolonged to such an extent that the f attainable is limited by the minimum time taken to contract and relax the muscles.},

These estimates were made by the following methods: 1) using the work loop technique and measuring the actual mechanical work (WA) produced by rat soleus muscles (n = 6) at four different frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 Hz) and seven different amplitudes of length change (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 mm); 2) determining the force-velocity relationships of the soleus muscles and using this data to quantify the theoretical mechanical work (WT) that could be produced under the work loop conditions described above; and 3) subtracting WA from WT. The difference between WT and WA was interpreted to represent limitations imposed by activation and relaxation. Under certain conditions (high frequency, small strain), factors controlling the kinetics of activation and relaxation reduced the mechanical work of the soleus muscle by approximately 60\%. Hence, activation and relaxation collectively represent important factors limiting the production of mechanical work by slow skeletal muscle.},

The cyclical nature of muscle position during locomotion for muscles such as the soleus and plantaris is such that either constant force or velocity is rarely attained. In the present study, the work loop technique, a technique developed to measure maximal attainable power output from muscles undergoing cyclic length changes, was undertaken to determine whether simulating in vivo function alters the power-velocity relationship of the soleus and plantaris and, in particular, the velocity of shortening that produces maximal power (V(opt)-wl). FV relationships were determined for both soleus (n = 4) and plantaris (n = 4) muscles in situ from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats by measuring shortening velocities during afterloaded isotonic contractions. The velocity that produced maximal power using FV relationships, V(opt)-fv, was 54.6 +/- 0.7 mm/s for the plantaris vs. 20.2 +/- 1.2 mm/s for the soleus. Then, the work loop technique was employed to measure net power from these same muscles at multiple cycling frequencies (1.5 to 4.0 Hz for the soleus; 4.0 to 8.0 Hz for the plantaris). Multiple power-velocity curves were generated (one at each cycle frequency) by varying the strain (1-8 mm). Thus, at each cycle frequency, V(opt)-wl could be identified. For both the plantaris and soleus, V(opt)-wl at each cycle frequency was not different from their respective V(opt)-fv value. Thus both fast and slow skeletal muscles have inherent optimal shortening velocities, identifiable with FV relationships, that dictate their respective maximal attainable mechanical power production using the work loop technique.},

	abstract = {Flapping flight is the most power-demanding mode of locomotion, associated with a suite of anatomical specializations in extant adult birds. In contrast, many developing birds use their forelimbs to negotiate environments long before acquiring “flight adaptations,” recruiting their developing wings to continuously enhance leg performance and, in some cases, fly. How does anatomical development influence these locomotor behaviors? Isolating morphological contributions to wing performance is extremely challenging using purely empirical approaches. However, musculoskeletal modeling and simulation techniques can incorporate empirical data to explicitly examine the functional consequences of changing morphology by manipulating anatomical parameters individually and estimating their effects on locomotion. To assess how ontogenetic changes in anatomy affect locomotor capacity, we combined existing empirical data on muscle morphology, skeletal kinematics, and aerodynamic force production with advanced biomechanical modeling and simulation techniques to analyze the ontogeny of pectoral limb function in a precocial ground bird (Alectoris chukar). Simulations of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) using these newly developed musculoskeletal models collectively suggest that immature birds have excess muscle capacity and are limited more by feather morphology, possibly because feathers grow more quickly and have a different style of growth than bones and muscles. These results provide critical information about the ontogeny and evolution of avian locomotion by (i) establishing how muscular and aerodynamic forces interface with the skeletal system to generate movement in morphing juvenile birds, and (ii) providing a benchmark to inform biomechanical modeling and simulation of other locomotor behaviors, both across extant species and among extinct theropod dinosaurs.},

	abstract = {The force–velocity relationship has frequently been used to predict the shortening velocity that muscles should use to generate maximal net power output. Such predictions ignore other well-characterized intrinsic properties of the muscle, such as the length–force relationship and the kinetics of activation and deactivation (relaxation). We examined the effects of relative shortening velocity on the maximum net power output (over the entire cycle) of mouse soleus muscle, using sawtooth strain trajectories over a range of cycle frequencies. The strain trajectory was varied such that the proportion of the cycle spent shortening was 25, 50 or 75 \% of the total cycle duration.A peak isotonic power output of 167 W kg−1 was obtained at a relative shortening velocity (V/Vmax) of 0.22. Over the range of cyclical contractions studied, the optimal V/Vmax for power production ranged almost fourfold from 0.075 to 0.30, with a maximum net power output of 94 W kg−1. The net power output increased as the proportion of the cycle spent shortening increased. Under conditions where the strain amplitude was high (i.e. low cycle frequencies and strain trajectories where the proportion of time spent shortening was greater than that spent lengthening), the effects of the length–force relationship reduced the optimal V/Vmax below that predicted from the force–velocity curve. At high cycle frequencies and also for strain trajectories with brief shortening periods, higher rates of activation and deactivation with increased strain rate shifted the optimal V/Vmax above that predicted from the force–velocity relationship. Thus, the force–velocity relationship alone does not accurately predict the optimal V/Vmax for maximum power production in muscles that operate over a wide range of conditions (e.g. red muscle of fish).The change in the rates of activation and deactivation with increasing velocity of stretch and shortening, respectively, made it difficult to model force accurately on the basis of the force–velocity and length–force relationships and isometric activation and deactivation kinetics. The discrepancies between the modelled and measured forces were largest at high cycle frequencies.},

Under optimum conditions, the EDL produced a maximum mean power output of 107 W kg-1 at a cycle frequency of 10 Hz. In comparison, the maximum mean power output of the soleus was 34 W kg-1 at 5 Hz cycle frequency. Video analysis of mice determined the stride frequency range to be from 2.87 Hz at a walk to 8.23 Hz at a flat-out gallop, with the trot-to-gallop transition occurring at 5.89 Hz. In vivo EDL electromyogram (EMG) activity is recorded primarily during shortening and the muscle operates in a power-generating mode. The soleus is close to isometric when EMG activity is recorded, but mechanical activity persists into the shortening phase. Both muscles are likely to operate over cycle frequency ranges just below, or at, those yielding maximal power. Soleus and EDL produced maximal power output in vitro when operating at mean sarcomere lengths of 2.58 μm and 2.71 μm respectively. These lengths are slightly above the plateau of the length–force curve predicted for rat leg muscle (2.3–2.5 μm). The sarcomere length ranges used in vivo by the soleus and EDL were determined, by fixing muscles in the extreme active positions predicted from video and cine analysis, to be 2.28–2.57 μm and 2.49–2.88 μm respectively. These ranges are both close to those shown to yield maximum power output in vitro and to the plateau of the sarcomere length–force curve.},

	abstract = {In vivo measurements of pectoralis muscle force during different modes of free flight (takeoff, level flapping, landing, vertical ascending and near vertical descending flight) were obtained using a strain gauge attached to the dorsal surface of the delto-pectoral crest (DPC) of the humerus in four trained pigeons (Columbalivia). In one bird, a rosette strain gauge was attached to the DPC to determine the principal axis of strain produced by tension of the pectoralis. Strain signals recorded during flight were calibrated to force based on in situ measurements of tetanic force and on direct tension applied to the muscle’s insertion at the DPC. Rosette strain recordings showed that at maximal force the orientation of tensile principal strain was −15° (proximo-anterior) to the perpendicular axis of the DPC (or +75° to the longitudinal axis of the humerus), ranging from +15 to −25° to the DPC axis during the downstroke. The consistency of tensile principal strain orientation in the DPC confirms the more general use of single-element strain gauges as being a reliable method for determining in vivo pectoralis force generation. Our strain recordings show that the pectoralis begins to develop force as it is being lengthened, during the final one-third of the upstroke, and attains maximum force output while shortening during the first one-third of the downstroke. Force is sustained throughout the entire downstroke, even after the onset of the upstroke for certain flight conditions. Mean peak forces developed by the pectoralis based on measurements from 40 wingbeats for each bird (160 total) were: 24.9±3.1N during takeoff, 19.7±2.0N during level flight (at speeds of about 6–9 ms−1 and a wingbeat frequency of 8.6±0.3Hz), 18.7±2.5N during landing, 23.7±2.7N during near-vertical descent, and 26.0±1.8N during vertical ascending flight. These forces are considerably lower than the maximum isometric force (67N, P0) of the muscle, ranging from 28\% (landing) to 39\% (vertical ascending) of P0. Based on estimates of muscle fiber length change determined from high-speed (200frames s−1) light ciné films taken of the animals, we calculate the mass-specific power output of the pigeon pectoralis to be 51 W kg−1 during level flight (approximately 8ms−1), and 119W kg−1 during takeoff from the ground. When the birds were harnessed with weighted backpacks (50\% and 100\% of body weight), the forces generated by the pectoralis did not significantly exceed those observed in unloaded birds executing vertical ascending flight. These data suggest that the range of force production by the pectoralis under these differing conditions is constrained by the force–velocity properties of the muscle operating at fairly rapid rates of shortening (4.4 fiberlengths s−1 during level flight and 6.7fiberlengths s−1 during takeoff).},

	abstract = {We review here the use and reliability of Hill-type muscle models to predict muscle performance under varying conditions, ranging from in situ production of isometric force to in vivo dynamics of muscle length change and force in response to activation. Muscle models are frequently used in musculoskeletal simulations of movement, particularly when applied to studies of human motor performance in which surgically implanted transducers have limited use. Musculoskeletal simulations of different animal species also are being developed to evaluate comparative and evolutionary aspects of locomotor performance. However, such models are rarely validated against direct measures of fascicle strain or recordings of muscle–tendon force. Historically, Hill-type models simplify properties of whole muscle by scaling salient properties of single fibers to whole muscles, typically accounting for a muscle’s architecture and series elasticity. Activation of the model’s single contractile element (assigned the properties of homogenous fibers) is also simplified and is often based on temporal features of myoelectric (EMG) activation recorded from the muscle. Comparison of standard one-element models with a novel two-element model and with in situ and in vivo measures of EMG, fascicle strain, and force recorded from the gastrocnemius muscles of goats shows that a two-element Hill-type model, which allows independent recruitment of slow and fast units, better predicts temporal patterns of in situ and in vivo force. Recruitment patterns of slow/fast units based on wavelet decomposition of EMG activity in frequency–time space are generally correlated with the intensity spectra of the EMG signals, the strain rates of the fascicles, and the muscle–tendon forces measured in vivo, with faster units linked to greater strain rates and to more rapid forces. Using direct measures of muscle performance to further test Hill-type models, whether traditional or more complex, remains critical for establishing their accuracy and essential for verifying their applicability to scientific and clinical studies of musculoskeletal function.},

	abstract = {A muscle’s performance is influenced by where it operates on its force–length (F–L) curve. Here we explore how activation and tendon compliance interact to influence muscle operating lengths and force-generating capacity. To study this, we built a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb of the guinea fowl and simulated the F–L operating range during fixed-end fixed-posture contractions for 39 actuators under thousands of combinations of activation and posture using three different muscle models: Muscles with non-compliant tendons, muscles with compliant tendons but no activation-dependent shift in optimal fiber length (L0), and muscles with both compliant tendons and activation-dependent shifts in L0. We found that activation-dependent effects altered muscle fiber lengths up to 40\% and increased or decreased force capacity by up to 50\% during fixed-end contractions. Typically, activation-compliance effects reduce muscle force and are dominated by the effects of tendon compliance at high activations. At low activation, however, activation-dependent shifts in L0 are equally important and can result in relative force changes for low compliance muscles of up to 60\%. There are regions of the F–L curve in which muscles are most sensitive to compliance and there are troughs of influence where these factors have little effect. These regions are hard to predict, though, because the magnitude and location of these areas of high and low sensitivity shift with compliance level. In this study we provide a map for when these effects will meaningfully influence force capacity and an example of their contributions to force production during a static task, namely standing.},

	abstract = {A model is developed to predict the force generated by active skeletal muscle when subjected to imposed patterns of lengthening and shortening, such as those that occur during normal movements. The model is based on data from isolated lamprey muscle and can predict the forces developed during swimming. The model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations, which are solved numerically. The model's first part is a simplified description of the kinetics of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and binding to muscle protein filaments, in response to neural activation. The second part is based on A. V. Hill's mechanical model of muscle, consisting of elastic and contractile elements in series, the latter obeying known physiological properties. The parameters of the model are determined by fitting the appropriate mathematical solutions to data recorded from isolated lamprey muscle activated under conditions of constant length or rate of change of length. The model is then used to predict the forces developed under conditions of applied sinusoidal length changes, and the results compared with corresponding data. The most significant advance of this model is the incorporation of work-dependent deactivation, whereby a muscle that has been shortening under load generates less force after the shortening ceases than otherwise expected. In addition, the stiffness in this model is not constant but increases with increasing activation. The model yields a closer prediction to data than has been obtained before, and can thus prove an important component of investigations of the neural—mechanical—environmental interactions that occur during natural movements.},

	abstract = {The power output of a muscle and its efficiency vary widely under different activation conditions. This is partially due to the complex interaction between the contractile component of a muscle and the serial elasticity. We investigated the relationship between power output and efficiency of muscle by developing a model to predict the power output and efficiency of muscles under varying activation conditions during cyclical length changes. A comparison to experimental data from two different muscle types suggests that the model can effectively predict the time course of force and mechanical energetic output of muscle for a wide range of contraction conditions, particularly during activation of the muscle. With fixed activation properties, discrepancies in the work output between the model and the experimental results were greatest at the faster and slower cycle frequencies than that for which the model was optimised. Further optimisation of the activation properties across each individual cycle frequency examined demonstrated that a change in the relationship between the concentration of the activator (Ca2+) and the activation level could account for these discrepancies. The variation in activation properties with speed provides evidence for the phenomenon of shortening deactivation, whereby at higher speeds of contraction the muscle deactivates at a faster rate. The results of this study demonstrate that predictions about the mechanics and energetics of muscle are possible when sufficient information is known about the specific muscle.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify the principal factors that determine the time course of force and power output by muscle during patterns of stimulation and movement similar to those during fish swimming. Fully activated, white muscle fibres isolated from dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula were used to characterize the force–velocity relationship of the contractile component (CC) and the stress–strain relationship of the passive, elastic component (SEC) in series with the CC. A simple model of the time course of crossbridge activation during brief contractions was devised. Using the mechanical properties of the CC and SEC and the activation time course, force and power were predicted for brief contractions with constant-velocity movement and also for brief contractions starting at various times during sinusoidal movement. The predicted force and power were compared with observations for these patterns of stimulation and movement. The predictions matched the observations well for the period during stimulation. Matching of force was much less good for some specific conditions during relaxation, the period during which force persists after the end of stimulation. If either the slow rise of activation or the SEC was omitted from the calculation, the predictions were poor, even during stimulation. Additional factors which may influence force are discussed. These include the after-effects of shortening and stretch, the variation of force during constant-velocity stretch and non-uniform behaviour within the muscle.},

These measurements provide a description of the force/ length properties of the pectoralis under dynamic conditions during two discrete flight behaviors and allow an examination of the effects of differences in body size and morphology on pectoralis performance by comparing the results with those of a recent similar study of slow level flight in pigeons (Columbia livia). In the present study, the mallard pectoralis showed a distinct pattern of active lengthening during the upstroke. This probably enhances the rate of force generation and the magnitude of the force generated and, thus, the amount of work and power produced during the downstroke. The power output of the pectoralis averaged 17.0 W kg−1 body mass (131 W kg−1muscle mass) during slow level flight (3 m s−1) and 23.3 W kg−1 body mass (174 W kg−1 muscle mass) during ascending flight. This increase in power was achieved principally via an increase in muscle strain (29 \% versus 36 \%), rather than an increase in peak force (107 N versus 113 N) or cycle frequency (8.4 Hz versus 8.9 Hz). Body-mass-specific power output of mallards during slow level flight (17.0 W kg−1), measured in terms of pectoralis mechanical power, was similar to that measured recently in pigeons (16.1 W kg−1). Mallards compensate for their greater body mass and proportionately smaller wing area and pectoralis muscle volume by operating with a high myofibrillar stress to elevate mechanical power output.},

The time course of muscle force development was measured when one, two, or three stimuli were delivered at the onset of constant velocity shortening. As the shortening velocity increased several parameters decreased including the maximum force, the time course for the contraction and the relative duration of the deactivation compared to the activation. The maximum force and the relative rates of activation to deactivation for the contraction were relatively independent of temperature, whereas the duration of the contraction decreased with increasing temperature. A predictive model was developed which was based on fitting a modified Weibull distribution to these observations. The model was used to interpolate the expected contractile forces during cyclic length-changes. Measured and predicted values for force and power during such cyclic work-loop experiments showed an excellent agreement over the range of shortening regimes typically found during swimming behaviours. However, the predicted force was overestimated during the deactivation phase of the contractions when the shortening velocities exceeded those found during swimming.},

This simulated force was compared with the experimental force of the same muscle measured in response to the same lOI as input. Tetanic contractions were used in all experiments. The results show that this muscle model can predict the experimental force within a mean maximal error not larger than approximately 14\% of the force amplitude. However the comparison of simulated force with experimental force and a few additional experiments show that the muscles do not have a unique instantaneous force-velocity characteristic.

The upstroke is therefore aerodynamically active and the circulation appears to remain constant along the wing whose geometry is altered during the course of the wing stroke. It is argued that the flight kinematics, and so the wake structure, of the kestrel may be typical of flapping flight at medium speeds and a flight model based on this wake geometry is presented. Rough estimates of the rate of momentum generated in the wake balance the weight almost exactly and a direct estimate of the induced power requirement from the wake measurements is obtained. The significance of these results for the various alternative aerodynamic descriptions and energetic predictions of models of flapping animal flight is briefly assessed.},

Neurophysiol. 77: 1538?1552, 1997. Muscle is usually studied under nonphysiological conditions, such as tetanic stimulation or isovelocity movements, conditions selected to isolate specific properties or mechanisms in muscle. The purpose of this study was to measure the function of cat soleus muscle during physiological conditions, specifically a simulation of a single speed of slow walking, to determine whether the resulting force could be accurately represented by a Hill-type model. Because Hill-type models do not include history-dependent muscle properties or interactions among properties, the magnitudes of errors in predicted forces were expected to reveal whether these phenomena play important roles in the physiological conditions of this locomotor pattern. The natural locomotor length pattern during slow walking, and the action potential train for a low-threshold motor unit during slow walking, were obtained from the literature. The whole soleus muscle was synchronously stimulated with the locomotor pulse train while a muscle puller imposed the locomotor movement. The experimental results were similar to force measured via buckle transducer in freely walking animals. A Hill-type model was used to simulate the locomotor force. In a separate set of experiments, the parameters needed for a Hill-type model (force-velocity, length-tension, and stiffness of the series elastic element) were measured from the same muscle. Activation was determined by inverse computation of an isometric contraction with the use of the same locomotor stimulus pattern. During the stimulus train, the Hill-type model fit the locomotor data fairly well, with errors {\textless}10\% of maximal tetanic tension. A substantial error occurred during the relaxation phase. The model overestimated force by ?30\% of maximal tetanic tension. A nonlinear series elastic element had little influence on the force predicted by a Hill model, yet dramatically altered the predicted muscle fiber lengths. Further experiments and modeling were performed to determine the source of errors in the Hill-type model. Isovelocity ramps were constructed to pass through a selected point in the locomotor movement with the same velocity and muscle length. The muscle was stimulated with the same locomotor pulse train. The largest errors again occurred during the relaxation phase following completion of the stimulus. Stretch during stimulation caused the Hill model to underestimate the relaxation force. Shortening movements during stimulation caused the Hill model to overestimate the relaxation force. These errors may be attributed to the effects of movement on crossbridge persistence, and/or the changing affinity of troponin for calcium between bound and unbound crossbridges, neither of which is well represented in a Hill model. Other sources of error are discussed. The model presented represents the limit of accuracy of a basic Hill-type model applied to cat soleus. The model had every advantage: the parameters were measured from the same muscle for which the locomotion was simulated and errors that could arise in the estimation of activation dynamics were avoided by inverse calculation. The accuracy might be improved by compensating for the apparent effects of velocity and length on activation. Further studies are required to determine to what degree these conclusions can be generalized to other movements and muscles.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish the extent of extramuscular myofascial force transmission for dissected rat medial gastrocnemius (GM) and plantaris (PL) muscles. Initially, this was done with GM still connected to extramuscular connective tissue (general fascia, neuro-vascular tract and compartmental fascia). Neighbouring muscles were also connected to these tissues. In a later stage, it was dissected progressively until finally a fully dissected in situ GM was obtained, for which the neuro-vascular tract (i.e. the nerves, bloodvessels and the surrounding connective tissue)was the only extramuscular tissue left intact. Force of GM was measured not only at its distal tendon in progressive stages of dissection, but also at its dissected proximal tendon. In the stage where GM was still connected to extramuscular tissues, the experiments showed that up to 40.5±5.9\%(mean ± s.e.m.) of the force exerted by the neighbouring PL muscle was transmitted onto the calcaneal bone, even when the PL tendon was not connected to this bone. After distal PL-tenotomy, a difference between proximally and distally measured forces of GM constituted evidence for myofascial force transmission. In the fully dissected in situ GM muscle, no relevant myofascial force transmission occurred in the reference position (the position of the GM origin corresponding to a knee angle of 120°). However, some myofascial force transmission occurred when the relative position of the origin of the fully dissected GM muscle was changed with respect to the neuro-vascular tract.},

	abstract = {A simulation based on a forward dynamical musculoskeletal model was computed from an optimal control algorithm to understand uni- and bi-articular muscle coordination of maximum-speed startup pedaling. The muscle excitations, pedal reaction forces, and crank and pedal kinematics of the simulation agreed with measurements from subjects. Over the crank cycle, uniarticular hip and knee extensor muscles provide 55\% of the propulsive energy, even though 27\% of the amount they produce in the downstroke is absorbed in the upstroke. Only 44\% of the energy produced by these muscles during downstroke is delivered to the crank directly. The other 56\% is delivered to the limb segments, and then transfererred to the crank by the ankle plantarflexors. The plantarflexors, especially soleus, also prevent knee hyperextension, by slowing the knee extension being produced during downstroke by the other muscles, including hamstrings. Hamstrings and rectus femoris make smooth pedaling possible by propelling the crank through the stroke transitions. Other simulations showed that pedaling can be performed well by partitioning all the muscles in a leg into two pairs of phase-controlled alternating functional groups, with each group also alternating with its contralateral counterpart. In this scheme, the uniarticular hip/knee extensor muscles (one group) are excited during downstroke, and the uniarticular hip/knee flexor muscles (the alternating group) during upstorke. The ankle dorsiflexor and rectus femoris muscles (one group of the other pair) are excited near the transition from upstroke to downstroke, and the ankle plantarflexors and hamstrings muscles (the alternating group) during the downstroke to upstroke transition. We conclude that these alternating functional muscle groups might represent a centrally generated primitive for not only pedaling but also other locomotor tasks as well.},

	abstract = {Avian locomotor burst performance (e.g. acceleration, maneuverability) decreases with increasing body size and has significant implications for the survivorship, ecology and evolution of birds. However, the underlying mechanism of this scaling relationship has been elusive. The most cited mechanistic hypothesis posits that wingbeat frequency alone limits maximal muscular mass-specific power output. Because wingbeat frequency decreases with body size, it may explain the often-observed negative scaling of flight performance. To test this hypothesis we recorded in vivo muscular mechanical power from work-loop mechanics using surgically implanted sonomicrometry (measuring muscle length change) and strain gauges (measuring muscle force) in four species of Corvidae performing burst take-off and vertical escape flight. The scale relationships derived for the four species suggest that maximum muscle-mass-specific power scales slightly negatively with pectoralis muscle mass (M–0.18m, 95\% CI: –0.42 to 0.05), but less than the scaling of wingbeat frequency (M–0.29m, 95\% CI: –0.37 to –0.23). Mean muscle stress was independent of muscle mass (M–0.02m, 95\% CI: –0.20 to 0.19), but total muscle strain (percent length change) scaled positively (M0.12m, 95\% CI: 0.05 to 0.18), which is consistent with previous results from ground birds (Order Galliformes). These empirical results lend minimal support to the power-limiting hypothesis, but also suggest that muscle function changes with size to partially compensate for detrimental effects of size on power output, even within closely related species. Nevertheless, additional data for other taxa are needed to substantiate these scaling patterns.},

The muscle was a flight muscle of the tettigoniid Neoconocephalus triops. The measurements were made at the normal wing-stroke frequency for flight (25 Hz) and operating temperature (30°C).The power output with a single stimulus per cycle, optimal excursion amplitude, and optimal stimulus phase was 1·52 J kg−1 cycle−1 or 37Wkg−1. The maximum power output occurs at a phase such that the onset of the twitch coincides with the onset of the shortening half of the length cycle. The optimum excursion amplitude was 5·5\% rest length; with greater excursion, work output declined because of decreasing muscle force associated with the more rapid shortening velocity.Multiple stimulation per cycle increases the power output above that available with twitch contractions. In this muscle, the maximum mechanical power output at 25 Hz was 76 Wkg−1 which was achieved with three stimuli per cycle separated by 4-ms intervals and an excursion amplitude of 6·0\% rest length.The maximum work output during the shortening of an isotonic twitch contraction was about the same as the work done over a full sinusoidal shortening-lengthening cycle with a single stimulus per cycle and optimum excursion amplitude and phase.},

The power output of these muscles must be modulated to meet the changing power requirements of flight across a range of speeds. This can be achieved at the muscle level by manipulation of strain trajectory and recruitment patterns, and/or by intermittent flight strategies. We have measured the in vitro power outputs of pectoralis muscle fascicles from budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus and zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata under conditions replicating those previously measured in vivo during flight. This has allowed us to quantify the extent to which different power modulation mechanisms control flight muscle power output. Intermittent flight behaviour is a more important determinant of flight power in zebra finches than budgerigars. This behaviour accounts for 25–62\% of power modulation relative to the maximum available mechanical power output in zebra finch, compared to 0–38\% in budgerigars. Muscle level changes in fascicle strain trajectory and motor unit recruitment, rather than intermittent flight behaviours, are the main determinants of pectoralis muscle power output in budgerigars at all speeds, and in zebra finch at speeds below 14 m s–1.},

	abstract = {We used high-speed video and electromyography (EMG) to measure in vivo performance of the trunk muscles (external obliques) in two related species of North American gray tree frogs, Hyla versicolor and Hyla chrysoscelis. Both species produce trilled calls with high sound intensity, but the sound pulse frequency within calls in H. chrysoscelis is twice that in H. versicolor. In both species, sound pulse frequency is directly correlated with the active contractions of the trunk muscles. The length trajectory during contraction and relaxation displays a saw-tooth pattern with a longer shortening phase compared with the lengthening phase. The longer time spent shortening may enhance power production, because the shortening phase is the active part of the cycle during which the muscle produces positive work. A similar total strain (approximately 21 \% and approximately 19 \% in H. versicolor and H. chrysoscelis respectively) is achieved in the first few pulses, and during subsequent pulses the muscle cycles with a reduced pulse strain (approximately 12 \% and approximately 7.3 \% in H. versicolor and H. chrysoscelis respectively). The higher pulse frequencies of H. chrysoscelis are thus associated with lower pulse strains. The EMG pattern is different in the two species. A single EMG stimulus occurs for each cycle in H. chrysoscelis, but two stimuli per cycle are found in H. versicolor. Indirect evidence suggests that the initial phase of shortening during a pulse is partly due to elastic recoil of the trunk.},

These measurements allow us to characterize the contractile behavior and mechanical power output of the pectoralis under dynamic conditions of slow level flight in pigeons Columba livia. Our recordings confirm that the pigeon pectoralis generates in vivo work loops that begin with the rapid development of force as the muscle is being stretched or remains nearly isometric near the end of the upstroke. The pectoralis then shortens by a total of 32 \% of its resting length during the downstroke, generating an average of 10.3±3.6J kg−1 muscle (mean ± S.D.) of work per cycle for the anterior and posterior sites recorded among the five animals. In contrast to previous kinematic estimates of muscle length change relative to force development, the sonomicrometry measurements of fascicle length change show that force declines during muscle shortening. Simultaneous measurements of fascicle length change at anterior and posterior sites within the same muscle show significant (P\&lt;0.001, three of four animals) differences in fractional length (strain) change that averaged 19±12 \%, despite exhibiting similar work loop shape. Length changes at both anterior and posterior sites were nearly synchronous and had an asymmetrical pattern, with shortening occupying 63 \% of the cycle. This nearly 2:1 phase ratio of shortening to lengthening probably favors the ability of the muscle to do work. Mean muscle shortening velocity was 5.38±1.33 and 4.88±1.27 lengths s−1 at the anterior and posterior sites respectively. Length excursions of the muscle were more variable at the end of the downstroke (maximum shortening), particularly when the birds landed, compared with highly uniform length excursions at the end of the upstroke (maximum lengthening). When averaged for the muscle as a whole, our in vivo work measurements yield a mass-specific net mechanical power output of 70.2 W kg−1 for the muscle when the birds flew at 5–6 m s−1, with a wingbeat frequency of 8.7 Hz. This is 38 \% greater than the value that we obtained previously for wild-type pigeons, but still 24–50 \% less than that predicted by theory.},

In this study, I use a combination of high-speed video analysis and force plate recording to measure the kinematics and mechanics of ground take-off in the European starling Sturnis vulgaris and the European migratory quail Coturnix coturnix. Counter to hypotheses based on the habits and morphology of each species, S. vulgaris and C. coturnix both produce 80–90 \% of the velocity of take-off with the hindlimbs. S. vulgaris performs a countermovement jump (peak vertical force four times body weight) followed by wing movement, while C. coturnix performs a squat jump (peak vertical force 7.8 times body weight) with simultaneous wing movement. The wings, while necessary for continuing the movement initiated by the hindlimbs and thereafter supporting the body weight, are not the primary take-off accelerator. Comparison with one other avian species in which take-off kinematics have been recorded (Columba livia) suggests that this could be a common pattern for living birds. Given these data and the fact that running take-offs such as those suggested for an evolving proto-flier are limited to large or highly specialized living taxa, a jumping model of take-off is proposed as a more logical starting point for the evolution of avian powered flight.},

	abstract = {Sonomicrometry and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made for the pectoralis muscle of blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis) during take-off and horizontal flight. In both modes of flight, the pectoralis strain trajectory was asymmetrical, with 70 \% of the total cycle time spent shortening. EMG activity was found to start just before mid-upstroke and continued into the downstroke. The wingbeat frequency was 23 Hz, and the total strain was 23 \% of the mean resting length.Bundles of fibres were dissected from the pectoralis and subjected in vitro to the in vivo length and activity patterns, whilst measuring force. The net power output was only 80 W kg–1 because of a large artefact in the force record during lengthening. For more realistic estimates of the pectoralis power output, we ignored the power absorbed by the muscle bundles during lengthening. The net power output during shortening averaged over the entire cycle was approximately 350 W kg–1, and in several preparations over 400 W kg–1. Sawtooth cycles were also examined for comparison with the simulation cycles, which were identical in all respects apart from the velocity profile. The power output during these cycles was found to be 14 \% lower than during the in vivo strain trajectory. This difference was due to a higher velocity of stretch, which resulted in greater activation and higher power output throughout the later part of shortening, and the increase in shortening velocity towards the end of shortening, which facilitated deactivation.The muscle was found to operate at a mean length shorter than the plateau of the length/force relationship, which resulted in the isometric stress measured at the mean resting length being lower than is typically reported for striated muscle.},

	abstract = {The effects of length trajectory on the mechanical power output of mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were investigated using the work loop technique in vitro at 37 °C. Muscles were subjected to sinusoidal and sawtooth cycles of lengthening and shortening; for the sawtooth cycles, the proportion of the cycle spent shortening was varied. For each cycle frequency examined, the timing and duration of stimulation and the strain amplitude were optimized to yield the maximum power output. During sawtooth length trajectories, power increased as the proportion of the cycle spent shortening increased. The increase in power was attributable to more complete activation of the muscle due to the longer stimulation duration, to a more rapid rise in force resulting from increased stretch velocity and to an increase in the optimal strain amplitude. The power produced during symmetrical sawtooth cycles was 5–10 \% higher than during sinusoidal work loops. Maximum power outputs of 92W kg−1 (soleus) and 247 W kg−1 (EDL) were obtained by manipulating the length trajectory. For each muscle, this was approximately 70 \% of the maximum power output estimated from the isotonic force–velocity relationship.We have found a number of examples suggesting that animals exploit prolonging the shortening phase during activities requiring a high power output, such as flying, jet-propulsion swimming and vocalization. In an evolutionary context, increasing the relative shortening duration provides an alternative to increasing the maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) as a way to increase power output.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait.},

	abstract = {Introduction: 

During fixed-ankle FES cycling in paraplegics, in which the leg position is completely determined by the crank angle, mechanical power output is low. This low power output limits the cardiovascular load that could be realized during FES ergometer cycling, and limits possibilities for FES cycling as a means of locomotion. Stimulation of ankle musculature in a released-ankle setup might increase power output. However, releasing the ankle joint introduces a degree of freedom in the leg that has to be controlled, which imposes constraints on the stimulation pattern.

Methods:

In this study, a forward dynamics modeling/simulation approach was used to assess the potential effect of releasing the ankle on the maximal mechanical power output.

Results:

For the released-ankle setup, the optimal stimulation pattern was found to be less tightly related to muscle shortening/lengthening than for the fixed-ankle setup, which indicates the importance of the constraints introduced by releasing the ankle. As a result, the maximal power output for 45-RPM cycling in the released-ankle setup was found to be about 10\% lower than with a fixed ankle, despite the additional muscle mass available for stimulation. Power output for the released-ankle setup can be improved by tuning the point of contact between the foot and pedal to the relative strength of the ankle plantar flexors. For the model used, power output was 14\% higher than for the fixed-ankle setup when this point of contact was moved posteriorly by 0.075 m.

Conclusion:

Releasing the ankle joint and stimulating the triceps surae and tibialis anterior is expected to result in a modest increase in power output at best.},

	abstract = {A cyclist?s performance depends critically on the generated average mechanical power output (AMPO). The instantaneous mechanical power output equals the product of crank angular velocity, crank length, and the tangential pedal force. Radial pedal forces do not contribute to mechanical power. It has been suggested that radial pedal forces arise from suboptimal pedaling technique and that limiting these would increase AMPO and efficiency. Here, we presented an optimal control musculoskeletal model of a cyclist (consisting of five segments driven by nine Hill-type muscle-tendon units) to predict maximal AMPO during sprint cycling at different levels of allowed radial pedal forces. Our findings showed that limiting radial pedal forces has a detrimental effect on maximal AMPO; it dropped from 1,115 W without a limit on radial forces to 528 W when no radial forces were allowed (both at 110 rpm). We explained that avoiding radial pedal forces causes ineffective use of muscles: muscles deliver less positive power and have a higher muscle power dissipation ratio (average mechanical power dissipated per unit of average positive power delivered). We concluded that radial pedal forces are an unavoidable by-product when optimizing for maximal AMPO and that limiting these leads to a performance decrease.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY In the literature, but also in the ?cycling field? [e.g., trainers, coaches, and (professional) cyclists], it is often suggested that trying to limit/avoid radial pedal forces enhances cycling technique and with that maximal average power output and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an optimal control model of a human cyclists (consisting of five segments and driven by nine Hill-type muscle-tendon complex models). With that we not only show, but also explain why limiting radial forces is a bad idea: it will decrease maximal attainable AMPO and will decrease efficiency.},

The variation of isometric tetanus tension with sarcomere length in single fibres from frog striated muscle has been re-investigated with special precautions to ensure uniformity of sarcomere length within the part of the fibre being studied. 2. In most respects the results of Ramsey \& Street (1940) were confirmed, but (a) the peak of the curve was found to consist of a plateau between sarcomere lengths of 2·05 and 2·2 ?, (b) the decline of tension above this plateau is steeper than found by Ramsey \& Street, and (c) the decline of tension below the plateau becomes suddenly steeper at a sarcomere length of about 1·67 ?. 3. Many features of this length?tension relation are simply explained on the sliding-filament theory. 4. It is concluded that, in the plateau and at greater lengths, the tension on each thin filament is made up of equal contributions from each bridge which it overlaps on adjacent thick filaments. 5.

	abstract = {Models are useful when studying how architectural and physiological properties of muscle-tendon complexes are related to function, because they allow for the simulation of the behaviour of such complexes during natural movements. In the construction of these models, evaluation of their accuracy is an important step. In the present study, a model was constructed to calculate the isometric force-length relationship of the rat extensor digitorum longus muscle-tendon complex. The model is based on the assumption that a muscle-tendon complex is a collection of independent units, each consisting of a muscle fibre in series with a tendon fibre. By intention, values for model parameters were derived indirectly, using only the measured maximal isometric tetanic force, the distance between origin and insertion at which it occurred (optimum lOI) and an estimate of muscle fibre optimal length. The accuracy of the calculated force-length relationship was subsequently evaluated by comparing it to the relationship measured in isometric tetanic contractions of a real complex in the rat. When the length of distal muscle fibres, measured during isometric contraction at optimal lOIof the whole complex, was used as an estimate for muscle fibre optimal length of all muscle fibre — tendon fibre units in the model, the calculated relationship was too narrow. That is, both on the ascending limb and on the descending limb the calculated tetanic force was lower than the measured tetanic force. These discrepancies could be explained partly by assuming that a spread existed in optimal lengths of the units, and that the units which contained the distal muscle fibres were acting below their optimal length during isometric contraction at optimal lOIof the whole complex.},

	abstract = {Abstract The I segment length has been measured and the number of thin filament periods per I segment has been counted in electron micrographs of Rhesus monkey and human leg muscle fibers. The number of I segment periods in the monkey fiber (60) and in the human fiber (66) multiplied by axial periodicity (385 Å) in thin filaments of living fibers (Huxley and BROWN, '67) plus 1,000 Å allowed for Z line width in living fibers, provided a formula for calculation of I segment lengths in living fibers. The calculated I segment lengths are 2.41 ? for the monkey and 2.64 ? for the human fiber. The ratio of calculated I segment length over an assumed constant thick filament length (1.6 ?) among vertebrates is in close agreement with the ratio of measured I segment length over measured thick filament length in micrographs of frog, rat, monkey and human leg muscle fibers. The calculated I segment length in the frog (1.95 ?) is compared with that of the human (2.64 ?) to show the relation of I segment length to the length-developed tension diagram and to the series elastic components of the skeletal muscle fiber.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscles transform neural control signals into forces that act upon the body segments to effect a coordinated motor task. This transformation is complex,  not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because the tendon  affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. This review focuses on  how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct models  applicable to studies of coordination. After a review of the properties of muscle  and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically  is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which  has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length  at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this  one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon  contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic  energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor  actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

	abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional muscle model with complex geometry is described and tested against experimental data. Using this model, several muscles were constructed. These muscles have equal optimum length but differ in architecture. The force exerted by the constructed muscles, in relation to their actual length and velocity of shortening, is discussed. Generally speaking, the constructed muscles with considerable pennation have great fiber angles, a great physiological cross section, a narrow active and steep passive length-force relation, and a low maximal velocity of shortening. The maximal power (force times velocity) delivered by the constructed muscles is shown to be almost independent of the architecture of the muscles. The steepness of the passive length-force relation is determined mainly by the shortest fibers within the group of constructed muscles, wheras maximal velocity of shortening and the width of the active length-force relation are determined mainly by the longest fibers. The validity of the three-dimensional muscle model with respect to some morphological and functional characteristics is tested. Length-force relations of constructed muscles are compared with the actual length-force relations of mm. gastrocnemii mediales and mm. semimembranosi of male Wistar rats. Moreover, actual fiber angle, fiber length, and muscle thickness of three mm. gastrocnemii mediales are compared with values found for constructed muscles. It is concluded that the three-dimensional muscle model closely approximates the actual muscle form and function.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the force exerted by the rat medial gastrocnemius (GM) muscle with either fast oxidative or fast glycolytic parts active during concentric and eccentric contractions at different velocities. The proximal end of the GM contains mainly fast oxidative fibres and the distal end predominantly fast glycolytic fibres. Different parts of GM were activated by selective stimulation of nerve branches. Fast oxidative or fast glycolytic muscle parts of anaesthetised male Wistar rats were activated maximally. After assessment of concentric force/velocity (F/v) relations (n=11), some of the muscles were subjected to a fatiguing series of isometric contractions (n=5). Fast oxidative muscle parts showed a significantly lower mean (±SD) maximal power output (Pmax 0.12±0.06 W) and fatigability than fast glycolytic muscle parts (Pmax 0.20±0.06 W). The remaining muscles performed eccentric contractions. The eccentric F/v curves were not significantly different for fast oxidative and fast glycolytic muscle parts (n=6). Maximum eccentric force relative to the maximum isometric force (157±3\% and 153±6\% respectively, P=0.99) was reached at a velocity of 60 mm s−1. It is concluded that eccentric F/v relations of rat GM with either fast oxidative or fast glycolytic parts active are very similar despite the differences in the concentric F/v relations.},
